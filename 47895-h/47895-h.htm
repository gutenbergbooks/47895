<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Owing to the practical impossibility of a student of gunnery
obtaining ready access to all the books, pamphlets, circulars,
orders, etc., necessary to fit him for the examinations as required
by General Orders of the War Department for first- and second-class
gunners, and also owing to the extreme difficulty the average
enlisted man has in comprehending the technical language in
which these books, pamphlets, etc., are couched,&mdash;provided he
does by some stroke of good fortune come into possession of
some of them,&mdash;the author has been impelled to compile this
work.</p>

<p>Effort has been made to eliminate all subjects that are not
included in the requirements of G. O. 141, 1904, yet being particular
that it contain all such subjects as an examining board
might fairly construe to be within the interest and scope of the
order.</p>

<p>As the art of gunnery changes from year to year, and the
scope of gunner's examinations changes likewise, it is intended
that this book be revised and published accordingly.</p>

<p>The preparation of this book was suggested to the author by
the members of his company&mdash;the 61st Coast Artillery.</p>

<p>As is well known, the first publication of a text-book is liable
to contain a few technical errors. The author will be grateful
for any information of such a character concerning this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>The author is indebted to Brigadier-General William Crozier
for supplying him with many pamphlets issued by the Ordnance
Department; to First Lieutenant W. K. Moore for correction of
proof and other matters; and to Master Electrician C. M. Beer,
Artillery Corps, for photographs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fort Totten, N. Y.</span>, February, 1905.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>


<p>In this edition the author has endeavored to make all the corrections
which were suggested to him during the past year, and
to add to the book descriptions, etc., of the new range-board, the
deflection-board, several later types of guns, and a brief discourse
on the loading, planting, and care of submarine mines according
to the new and adopted system.</p>

<p>The author desires to thank Captain R. P. Davis for his
revision of the "torpedo gunnery" contained in the work.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>


<p>As was stated in the preface of the first edition, this book
will be revised from year to year as the rules of gunnery change,
and this revision is made merely to bring the book up to date.</p>

<p>It is intended in this revision to conform strictly to G. O. 105,
1907, and to add to the book only such matter as will assist enlisted
men of the Coast Artillery Corps to pass their examinations
for first or second-class gunners.</p>

<p>The chapter on submarine mining is almost completely
revised, for the reason that the new system has undergone many
more radical changes within the past few years than has gunnery
in the Coast Artillery.</p>

<p>Several additions in mortar gunnery have been made in order
to keep pace with the rapid and remarkable development of this
arm of Coast Artillery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM GENERAL ORDERS NO. 105, WAR DEPARTMENT,
WASHINGTON, MAY 11, 1907.</h3>


<p>144. A candidate to be eligible for qualification as first-class
gunner must have previously qualified as second-class gunner,
though both qualifications may be made at the same examination.</p>

<p>145. Boards of examination shall be convened annually in
each artillery district by the district commander, to meet within
one month after the expiration of the indoor instruction period.
Separate boards may be convened for the examination of candidates
for first and second-class gunners and also for the posts
attached to the artillery district. All boards shall consist of three
artillery officers, selected with reference to their special qualifications
for this duty; provided, that when a member of the
board is a company commander he will, during the examination
of candidates from his company, be replaced by an officer of
another company. Where travel is necessary the selection of
an officer for this duty will be made subject to the approval of
the authority competent to order the necessary journeys.</p>

<p>146. Each company commander will, previous to the commencement
of the examination, submit to the adjutant a duly
signed list, in the triplicate, giving the full names, arranged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
muster-roll order, of all the men in his company who are to be
examined for first or second-class gunners, with the statement
that he believes that each man so presented is capable of qualifying
in the class designated. These lists will be transmitted to
the senior member of the board by the post commander.</p>

<p>147. In determining the qualifications of candidates credit
shall be given for practical knowledge of subjects rather than for
text-book answers to questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>During the test one member of the board will be at the target
and will personally superintend the marking.</p>

<p>The preliminary shots will be fired under direction of the examining
board until three hits have been obtained with the same
elevation and deflection. The center of impact of these three
shots will be referred to the horizontal and vertical axes through
the bulls'-eye of the target and its coordinates carefully measured.
This center of impact will not be on the miniature target and
may be changed by the board as often as they deem necessary
during the examination. These measurements, with the elevation
and deflection used, will be given to the candidate, who
will be required to make corrections corresponding to the distance
of the center of impact from the bull's-eye. Each candidate
will fire five shots, the piece being thrown off the target
between shots. Each shot will be marked as fired, the candidate
making such changes in elevation and deflection as he may deem
necessary before firing the next shot. The ratio of the candidates'
score to the maximum score possible will determine the credit,
the maximum credit being 20.</p>

<p>After this test the candidate will fire at the fixed subcaliber
target anchored at about 500 yards, without knowing the exact
distance, five rounds under service conditions in one minute and
thirty seconds. Three sighting shots will be allowed each candidate
preceding the latter test. Each hit on the material target
counts 6.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Give the general duties of a chief of detachment.</p>

<p>A. Each chief commands his own subdivision whenever it
acts separately; is responsible for its drill efficiency and for the
condition of the material to which it is assigned. He will especially
see that the gas-check seat is clean and kept free from
injury; that the projectile is rammed fully home; that the chamber
is sponged properly after each firing; that the vent is properly
served; that the cylinders are properly filled and the throttling-valve
properly set before firing; that the mushroom head
and gas-check are properly adjusted; that the kind of projectile
designated by the battery commander is used, and that the breech
detail observe great care and caution in sponging out and wiping
breech mechanism and recess free from powder residue, dirt,
etc., after each round fired.</p>

<p>Q. Describe how to signal <i>elevate</i> or <i>depress</i>.</p>

<p>A. Elevate: Raise either hand to the height of the head,
fingers pointing upward. Depress: Raise either hand to the
height of the head, fingers pointing downward.</p>

<p>Q. Describe how you would signal <i>traverse right</i> or <i>traverse left</i>.</p>

<p>A. Motion with either hand, fingers pointing in the required
direction.</p>

<p>Q. Give the signals for the following: Clamp or Halt; Ready.</p>

<p>A. Clamp or Halt: Raise either arm to a horizontal position,
fingers closed. Ready: Raise either arm vertically to its
full extent, fingers extended.</p>

<p>Q. How would you signal <i>stand fast</i> with the whistle at a
rapid-fire gun?</p>

<p>A. One blast signifies stand fast, the pause being of sufficient
duration to enable orders to be correctly given and received;
to resume operations the command "Go on!" will be given.
Other signals may also be used.</p>

<p>Nos. 11 and 12 bring loaded truck and place it in position,
adjusting height of shot-tray to that of the breech. No. 11 steps
to right, and No. 12 to left, of truck. If there be a brake, No. 12
sets it; if not, No. 11 chocks the front wheels. No. 12 places first
section of cartridge on tray, No. 11 the fourth. Both remove
truck to delivery-table and take posts at a loaded truck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Nos. 13 and 14 assist in ramming projectile and sections of
cartridge. Assist 9 and 10 at pinch-bars when piece will not trip.</p>

<p>No. 13 assists No. 4 in bringing up and replacing rammer.</p>

<p>No. 15 calls out and posts ranges and deflections or azimuths
received.</p>

<p>No. 16 notifies chief of ammunition detachment kind of projectile
required, also when to start and stop the hoist.</p>

<p>Nos. 16, 17, and 18 load the trucks.</p>

<p>Q. Give the positions of the ramming detail.</p>

<p>A. Nos. 1, 4, 9, and 13 on right. Nos. 2, 10, and 14 on left.
All face rammer and grasp it with both hands.</p>

<p>Q. Explain the method of ramming.</p>

<p>A. Nos. 13 and 14 take hold near the end of the rammer,
rammer-head being on base of projectile. At the command
"Ram!", all rush forward, carrying projectile to its seat with force.
Nos. 1 and 2 quit the rammer when near the truck. First three
sections of cartridge are rammed without command.</p>

<p>Q. Explain how to unload a dummy charge.</p>

<p>A. The chief commands "Unload!" Breech is opened and
truck brought up as for loading. No. 4 brings up extractor and
pulls out sections. No. 1 puts two sections on right of truck,
No. 2 puts others on left.</p>

<p>Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 withdraw projectile to truck. Truck is
removed and extractor replaced.</p>

<p>Q. Explain how to retract a gun.</p>

<p>A. Chief commands (1) "From battery!", (2) "Heave!", (3)
"Halt!"</p>

<p>At the first command Nos. 7 and 8 go to the retraction-cranks.
No. 7 operates the retaining-pawl and speed-crank to permit the
pulling out of the ropes. Nos. 9 and 10 mount on the gun-levers
and place the ends of the ropes on the hooks, receiving them from
Nos. 3 and 4, who mount on the chassis to assist. Nos. 1 and
2 pull out the ropes and pass the ends to Nos. 3 and 4. No. 7
takes in the slack. Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 take positions at the
retraction-cranks, and at the second command turn the cranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 relieve Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10 when directed
by the chief of the detachment. Odd numbers work on the
right side of the carriage, even numbers on the left side. When
the gun has reached the loading position the command "Halt!"
is given. As the command "Cast off!" is given No. 7 lets out
enough slack to enable Nos. 1 and 2 to take the rope-ends off the
hooks.</p>

<p>Q. Where electric motors are provided, who operates them?</p>

<p>A. The gunner the traversing-controllers, No. 5 the elevating
and retracting controllers; No. 6 watches the circuit-breakers,
and when broken by an overload he closes the breaker.</p>

<p>Q. When the shot-hoist is on the right, what changes in the
service of the piece are made?</p>

<p>A. No. 4 in ramming takes position between Nos. 2 and 10
on the left side. Nos. 10 and 14 assist No. 4 in bringing up and
replacing the rammer, instead of Nos. 9 and 13. No. 9 brings
up and replaces sponge and assists in sponging, instead of No. 10.</p>

<p>Q. How many men in the ammunition detail?</p>

<p>A. One chief and twelve privates.</p>

<p>Q. Name the details into which it is divided, and the numbers
composing each.</p>

<p>A. Hoist detail, Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Projectile detail, Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<p>Cartridge detail, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p>

<p>Q. Give the duties of each in brief.</p>

<p>A. No. 1 operates the controller and starts the hoist supplying
the delivery-table with ammunition.</p>

<p>No. 2 repeats name of projectile announced, rolls same with
cartridge to hoist-carrier.</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 4 operate a trolley and differential pulley.</p>

<p>Nos. 5 and 6 operate another trolley and pulley.</p>

<p>Nos. 7 and 8 uncase cartridges.</p>

<p>Nos. 9, 10, 11, and 12 place sections on receiving-table in
proper order. If electrical power fails, Nos. 1 and 2 operate
hoist by hand-cranks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Since the drills for the 10-inch and 8-inch disappearing
guns differ from the drill for the 12-inch in so few minor details,
no separate questions and answers in these cases are given. In
the 10-inch piece the following differences were noted: Nos. 13 and
14 are omitted in the rammer detail; No. 4 in procuring implements
attends to the rammer alone; in loading, No. 2 pushes the
second section of cartridge into the chamber instead of the fourth;
in ramming, the positions from front to rear are Nos. 1 and 9
on right, Nos. 2, 4, and 10 on left, facing rammer, etc. When
hoist is on right side No. 10 assists No. 4 (No. 13 being left out).</p>

<p>In the 8-inch piece the rammer detail consists of No. 4 (13 and
14 omitted), the truck detail of No. 11 (12 omitted), and the
hoist detail of Nos. 16 and 17 (No. 18 omitted). The duties of
the numbers omitted in these details are performed by the remaining
numbers in that detail, otherwise the drill is precisely
the same as for the 12-inch piece. In extracting a dummy Nos.
2 and 3 do not assist in withdrawing; Nos. 1 and 4 do this.</p>

carriage and place the loops of the ropes on the hooks. Nos. 1
and 2 pull out the ropes and pass the ends to Nos. 5 and 6.
No. 3 takes in the slack. Nos. 3 and 4 take positions at the
retraction-crank, and at the second command turn the crank.
Nos. 5 and 6 relieve Nos. 3 and 4 when directed by the chief of
detachment. When the gun has reached the loading position
the command "Halt!" is given. At the command "Cast off!"
No. 3 lets out enough slack to enable Nos. 1 and 2 to take the
loops off the hooks.</p>

<p>Q. In an emplacement provided with an ammunition-hoist
what changes in the above drill are made?</p>

<p>A. Nos. 5 and 6 serve projectiles from a loaded truck placed
in rear of the gun.</p>

<p>Nos. 9 and 10 are posted at the delivery-table, and run loaded
trucks to Nos. 5 and 6, returning empty ones.</p>

<p>Q. What composes an ammunition detachment?</p>

<p>A. One chief and five privates. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in the shell-room,
and Nos. 4 and 5 in the cartridge-room.</p>

<p>Q. Give their duties in brief.</p>

<p>A. The chief exercises general supervision.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 load trucks.</p>

<p>No. 3 runs up trucks convenient to the rear of gun, and returns
them to shell-room.</p>

<p>Nos. 4 and 5 uncase cartridges and pass them to No. 7.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Owing to the comparative simplicity and the similarity
of drill of almost all smaller-calibered pieces they are omitted
in this work.</p>

<h3>NOMENCLATURE AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION.</h3>

<p>Q. What are projectiles?</p>

<p>A. They correspond to the bullets in small-arm cartridges.</p>

<p>Q. Why are projectiles made oblong and guns rifled?</p>

<p>A. To prevent the projectile from tumbling, thereby securing
greater penetration, and better results in accuracy of fire.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between guns and mortars?</p>

<p>A. Guns are long in comparison with their calibers, mortars
are short in comparison with their calibers.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by a built-up gun?</p>

<p>A. One that is composed of several cylindrical forgings separately
shrunk one over the other.</p>

<p>Q. Why are these forgings shrunk on?</p>

<p>A. To give an initial compression to the steel toward the bore,
such that the strength of the gun to resist the pressure of the
powder-gas will be increased.</p>

<p>Q. Name the principal parts of a built-up gun.</p>

<p>A. The tube, jacket, hoops, and trunnion-band. (See Figs.
5, 6, and 23.)</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Q. What is a wire-wound gun?</p>

<p>A. One in which wire takes the place of the jacket and hoops
and is wound over the tube. The wire is really in the form of a
<i>ribbon</i>.</p>

<p>Q. Define the breech-reinforce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>A. That portion of the gun between the rear of the trunnion-band
and the front of the breech. (Fig. 5.)</p>

<p>Q. Define the chase.</p>

<p>A. That portion of the gun between the front of the trunnion-band
and the muzzle. (Fig. 5.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a barbette gun?</p>

<p>A. One that fires over a parapet.</p>

<p>Q. What two classes of barbette guns are there?</p>

<p>A. Barbette disappearing and barbette non-disappearing.</p>

<p>Q. What is the center of gravity?</p>

<p>A. That point where, if the gun were pivoted, it would balance.
It is always near the trunnions.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between front-pintle and center-pintle
carriages?</p>

<p>A. Front pintle is where the gun traverses about a point in
the front part of the carriage; center pintle where it traverses about
a point in the center of the carriage.</p>

<p>Q. What is a rack?</p>

<p>A. A bar or arc having teeth that engage in a gear-wheel
or worm. (See Fig. 7.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a gear-wheel?</p>

<p>A. A wheel with teeth on the circumference.</p>

<p>Q. What is a bevel-gear?</p>

<p>A. Two wheels whose axles are at an angle to each other and
whose teeth engage. (Fig. 8.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a miter-gear?</p>

<p>A. A bevel-gear with axles of equal-sized wheels at right
angles. (Fig. 9.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a worm?</p>

<p>A. A gear-wheel in the form of a continuous screw. (Fig. 10.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a sprocket-wheel?</p>

<p>A. A toothed wheel that engages the links of a chain. (Fig.
11.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a spur-wheel?</p>

<p>A. A gear-wheel with teeth parallel with the axle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wheel. If in Fig. 7 the rack were in form of a wheel, it would
be a spur-wheel. (The pinion is also a spur-wheel.)</p>

<p>Q. Describe how to set the azimuth indicator-plate for a
given azimuth.</p>

<p>A. Traverse the gun until the mark on the indicator-plate
representing the number of hundredths is opposite the mark on
the azimuth circle representing the number of degrees. In Fig.
30 the gun is set at 104°.05.</p>

<p>Q. How do you repack a stuffing-box?</p>

<p>A. If any of the old packing is used, it should be put in after
the new. See that the stuffing-boxes are well cleaned and
oiled.</p>

<p>Put on the piston-rod one ring of 1-inch Garlock's "waterproof
hydraulic" packing, and force it well to the bottom of the
stuffing-box by a wooden stick and mallet. Treat each layer
of packing in a similar manner, being careful to break joints
until five rings of new packing have been inserted, or an equal
amount of new and old when any of the latter is used. Place the
gland on the follower, enter them together in the box and screw
up the follower.</p>

<p>No more force should be used on the spanner-wrench than
that of two men, and generally that of one man is sufficient. The
addition of the pipe to the end of the spanner-wrench should
not be permitted.</p>

<p>Q. How do you remove old packing from recoil-cylinders?</p>

<p>A. Remove the gland and follower (using new extractor, to
be furnished by the Ordnance Department). Close the extractor
around the piston-rod and insert the locking-pin. Turn the
extractor to the left, with pressure on the packing, until the needles
are firmly engaged in the packing. Draw the packing out,
turning slowly to the left. In the case of a box with interior thread,
and if the ring is tight, it should be unscrewed and not stripped
out by the thread, because unless unscrewed it would catch upon
and be injured by the thread.</p>

<p>Extractor-bars are provided to be used for starting the packing
from its seat, and by inserting the toes of the bar in the rack-teeth
and prying over the edge of the box, being careful not to injure
the thread.</p>

<p>Q. What is the object of the throttling-valve?</p>

<p>A. To regulate the flow of oil from the front to the rear of the
recoil-cylinders. (See Fig. 31.)</p>

<p>Q. What precautions should be taken where the throttling-valve
is provided?</p>

<p>A. That there is a lock on the valve to prevent any one from
changing the setting without authority.</p>

<p>Q. Give some general directions for the care and preservation
of guns and gun-carriages.</p>

<p>A. All guns and carriages should be elevated and traversed
to their full limits daily. Ordinarily a gun and carriage should be
painted at least once a year. However, climatic conditions may
vary this rule. Sperm-oil, cosmic or light slushing oil should never
be applied to a surface that has a suspicion of grit, moisture, or
rust upon it. Brass gearing should have a thin film of sperm-oil
or synovial oil on it. All oil-holes and recoil-cylinders should
be examined daily at the beginning of drill. Special attention
should be given to grease-cups on disappearing guns to see that
they function properly. Retraction-ropes should be kept oiled
and cleaned. No part of the carriage should at any time be
allowed to rust, and if the carriage is to remain unused for short
intervals, all bright and bearing parts should be covered with a
thick coat of light slushing oil or cosmic. If the carriage is to
remain unused for long intervals, the cosmic should be mixed
with 25 per cent of resin. The mixture is well adapted for the
purpose, but must be renewed from time to time. The rollers
and roller-paths should be cleaned and covered with slush oil, and
the space between the dust-guard and base-ring should be filled
with waste or oakum to keep out dust, and wrench-holes
inside base-ring should be plugged tightly with fitted wooden
blocks.</p>

<p>To oil bore, use is made of an ordinary counter-brush secured
to the end of a rod and provided with a half-disc of wood to keep
the brush against the bore. By this means any required thickness
of the mixture may be applied. The brush-rod is, for the rifles,
fitted with a socket for connecting it with the special sponge-staff.
For mortars the brush is supplied with a special handle. As a
rule, the cosmic and resin mixture can be sufficiently removed
from the bore for firing by using the scraper alone, this being a
semicircular disc of iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Describe throttling bars.</p>

<p>A. Bars of steel bolted on the sides of recoil cylinders. (The
bolt heads can be seen on the outside of the cylinders.)</p>

<p>The piston head is slotted to receive the bars as shown in
Fig. 31, and the bars are thicker at one end than at the other,
this varies the amount of oil that can pass through the piston
head slots and therefore the pressure keeps uniform.</p>


<h4>CARE OF GUNS AND CARRIAGES.</h4>

<div class="center">(Extract from War Department, 1905.)</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Circular</span> }<br />
No. 48. &nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>

<p>Light slushing-oil will be used on the different parts of breech
mechanisms, including the threads on the block and in the breech
recess, in bores of guns, and on all other bright steel or iron surfaces
of mobile and seacoast armament, as a preservative when the
material is to remain unused for an appreciable length of time.
The slushing-oil will replace synovial oil as a lubricant for cross-head
guides, etc., which should be given a light coating only.
The use of light slushing-oil as a lubricant on breech mechanisms,
including the threads on the block and in the breech recess, is
forbidden: synovial oil will be used exclusively for lubricating
the different surfaces of breech mechanisms, including the threads
on the block and in the breech recess, on translating-screws and
rollers, and in all oil-holes and on gears, etc., of carriages. Number
4&frac12; lubricant only will be used in grease-cups. If exposed to
rain within thirty hours after its application, all surfaces should
be carefully examined and recoated if necessary. It can be applied
by means of paint-brushes known as sash-tools No. 6,
issued for that purpose. Except in very cold weather it can be
applied in a thin uniform coat by using the brush, as when painting.
During cold weather it should be applied by stippling&mdash;i.e.,
lightly tapping the surface with the end of the brush&mdash;the brush
being held perpendicular to the surface to be covered. It can be
applied to the bores of guns by means of the slush-brush issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for the purpose. In cold weather it should be warmed before
being applied to the bores of guns. <i>In all cases it should be applied
in a thin coat, since this is all that is necessary to give good protection.</i></p>

<p>This oil can be readily removed by the use of burlap or waste
dipped in kerosene oil. Lye dissolved in hot water and used
while hot will also remove it, but not as satisfactorily as kerosene
oil. In order to reduce the amount of kerosene oil to be used
for its removal, a thick coating of slushing-oil when present should
first be removed with a scraper before applying the kerosene.</p>

<p>Water without the addition of lye or kerosene should be
used for cleaning bores of guns after firing. They should be
permitted to drain and then be wiped dry before applying the
slushing-oil.</p>

<p>Before applying the slushing-oil to any surface it should be
thoroughly cleaned so as to be free from rust, water, kerosene
oil, lubricating-oil, etc., as their presence will cause rusting underneath
the slushing-oil. If applied to an oiled surface, the slushing-oil
has been found to run off when heated.</p>

<p>On account of the superior protection afforded by this material
it will not be necessary to completely remove it for inspection
purposes as frequently as has been found necessary
with the protecting materials heretofore used. Its frequent
removal from a limited area will serve as an indication of the
protection which is being afforded.</p>

<p>III. Mortars will hereafter be dismounted from their carriages
once every twelve months, and the trunnions and trunnion-beds
thoroughly cleaned, including the oil-grooves in the
trunnion-bed liners.</p>

<p>The counter-recoil springs will at the same time be dismounted,
the old paint removed, and each spring given two coats of new
paint. The spring should not be reassembled until the paint is dry.</p>

<p>By order of the Acting Secretary of War:</p>

<div class="right">
<span class="smcap">J. C. Bates</span>,<br />
<i>Major-General, Acting Chief of Staff.</i><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Describe the general parts of the throttling-valve and how
it operates.</p>

<p>A. The two equalizing-pipes connecting the front and rear
of opposite recoil-cylinders have a pipe connecting them; if this
pipe is open completely, oil can move freely from the front to
the rear of the cylinders. If it be closed partly by a valve called
the throttling-valve, much less oil will pass this way. Thus, by
regulating the adjustment of this valve, the recoil of the gun is
regulated. It is seen that the <i>throttling-bars</i> work <i>with</i> the
throttling-valve. (See Fig. 31.)</p>

<p>Q. How much oil should be removed from recoil-cylinders
having the filling-plugs on the top of the cylinders?</p>


<p>A.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>12-inch disappearing carriages, all models, 3 gallons.</p>

<p>10-inch disappearing carriages, all models, 1&frac12; gallons.</p>

<p>8-inch disappearing carriages, all models, 1 gallon.</p>

<p>6-inch disappearing carriages, model 1898, &frac12; gallon.</p></blockquote>


<p>Q. Where new filling-plugs have been inserted explain how
the cylinders are filled.</p>

<p>A. For full charges remove the two filling-plugs (one from each
cylinder), pour oil into one filling-hole until it flows out of the
hole in the other cylinder, wait a moment to allow the oil to settle,
and examine for any pocketed air or any temporary obstruction.
If necessary, pour in more oil until the oil is observed to be
in both cylinders up to the level of the filling-holes, then insert
the screw-plugs without removing any oil.</p>

<p>Q. Prior to firing, what should be done to the bore of the gun?</p>

<p>A. Prior to artillery practice the bore, including the powder-chamber,
of each piece to be used in practice will be thoroughly
cleaned and freed from lubricant before any shot is fired.</p>

<p>Q. How is powder residue removed after firing?</p>

<p>A. After firing the bore may be cleaned by using a sponge
covered with burlap well saturated with water. The bore should
then be permitted to drain and thoroughly dry before being oiled.</p>

<p>Q. If any rust has accumulated on a bearing part, would you
use sandpaper to remove it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>A. The use of sandpaper is forbidden, and emery-cloth No. 1,
being coarse enough for any ordinary rusting, should be used, the
rust being softened if necessary by kerosene.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the recoil-cylinder
for mortars and its
action.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 381px;">

<div class="caption"><p>RECOIL CYLINDER
FOR MORTARS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>A. Fig. 32. When the
mortar is fired, the piston is
forced down, causing the
piston-head to force oil
through the oil-holes shown
on the left of Fig 32. This
oil passes through the oil-cavity
upward and in rear of
the piston-head. By opening
or closing these oil-passages
by withdrawing or inserting
different-sized plugs the friction,
hence the recoil, can be
adjusted.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;For steel mortars
model '91 the plugs are as in
Fig. 32; that is, from top to
bottom: closed, &frac12;, 0, 0, &frac12;,
closed, closed. For C. I.
mortars '91: c., &frac12;, 0, 0, &frac34;, c.,
c. For model '96 c., &frac12;, &frac14;,
0, &frac14;.</p>

<p>Q. What are "grease-cups"?</p>

<p>A. Brass cups placed on the trunnions of guns to lubricate or
oil the trunnions and trunnion-beds.</p>

<p>Q. How are they filled and adjusted?</p>

<p>A. Fill up to the bevel edge of the cup with the special oil
provided by the Ordnance Department. The cup is then put on
and screwed down until the plunger sticks out one quarter of an
inch. By doing this a spring bearing on the plunger is forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
act, causing the plunger to press upon the oil, forcing it into the
grooves and channels cut under the trunnions. The plunger
should be kept at this distance (&frac14;") from the cap by screwing
down the cap from day to day. When the plunger will no longer
be pressed out it is known that no more oil is in the cup, and it
should be refilled.</p>

<p>Q. State some rules to be observed in painting guns and
carriages.</p>

<p>A. The gun is painted gray, and the carriage olive-green.
These are the only colors authorized. The entire surface of the
gun is painted except where the console, or tray, touches the gun.
Two coats annually are usually allowed.</p>

<p>Bronze trays will not be painted. Steel trays, excepting the
upper and front surfaces and guide-rails, will be painted the
same color as the gun. No parts of the breech-block or mechanism
will be painted. The unpainted surfaces will be kept
clean and bright with rottenstone and oil or "Putz-pomade."</p>

<p>All steel and iron non-bearing surfaces, both inside and out,
will be painted. This includes the exposed parts of shafts (except
squared ends), bottom plate of counterweight, ladders, cross-heads,
cranks (not handles), cross-head pawls (except teeth), and large
bronze pieces, including web and spokes of wheels and cylinder-heads.</p>

<p>The following parts are not painted: All wearing or bearing
surfaces, which includes the handles of hand-wheels and cranks,
teeth of all gear-wheels, teeth of cross-head pawls, teeth of cross-heads,
elevating-rack guides, rollers and surfaces on which they
travel, piston-rods, crosshead-guides, etc.</p>

<p>The bronze sight-holders will not be painted, nor will the
azimuth and elevating-scales and pointers and the followers of
the stuffing-boxes; these parts will be kept clean and, with the
exception of the sight-holders, will also be kept bright with rottenstone
and oil or "Putz-pomade."</p>

<p>The raised surfaces of letters and rims of direction and name-plates
are to be kept clean and bright; the background of these
plates will be painted the same color as the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Name-plates shall never be removed in painting the carriage.
This is prohibited by orders.</p>

<p>Q. How is old paint removed?</p>

<p>A. Dissolve one pound of concentrated lye, powdered form,
in six pints of hot water, and slake in enough lime to give the
solution the consistency of paint. Use the solution freely mixed,
and apply to the parts where paint is to be removed, with a brush
preferably, or with waste tied on the end of a stick. When the
solution begins to dry on the surface use a scraper to remove the
old paint, and complete the cleaning of the surface with a mop and
water. If one application is not sufficient to loosen the paint,
apply a second coat. Before applying the new coat of paint
wash the surface with liquid made by dissolving one half pound
of washing-soda in eight quarts of water, and wipe dry. Let
stand a sufficient length of time to have all parts thoroughly dry
before painting.</p>

<p>Q. Should oil or grease ever be applied to the surfaces of
electrical contacts on a gun or carriage?</p>

<p>A. No. Grease or oil acts as an insulator and prevents the
current from passing the contacts.</p>

<p>Q. Point out or describe the following parts of a battery:
Emplacement, parapet, traverse, parados, exterior slope, interior
crest, interior slope, superior slope, interior wall, gun-platform,
truck-platform, loading-platform.</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 14.</p>

<p>Q. Explain how to adjust the firing mechanism.</p>

<p>A. Insert the safety bar in the safety-bar notch of the slide
housing. Slip the slide housing over the spindle, at the same
time inserting the safety bar in its recess in the breech block.
Press both home firmly. Slip on the yoke, pressing down until
the notch above the ring is just visible. (In this operation it
may be necessary further to adjust the spindle if the yoke does
not go on completely, and the gas-check pad may have to be
flattened for this purpose.)</p>

<p>Put the ejector in place with the ejector raised and the slide
stop pulled out. Place the slide in position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. When the weather is freezing what should be done to the
recoil-cylinders before firing service charges?</p>

<p>A. A small amount of oil should be taken out and a reduced
charge fired, then fill the cylinders and fire full service.</p>

<p>Q. Where should primers and fixed ammunition be
kept?</p>

<p>A. Separate place from powder: never in the magazine.
Primers should be kept preferably in the ammunition-chests, and
fixed ammunition in the shot-room.</p>

<p>Q. How is the weight of a cored shot or plugged shell brought
to standard weight?</p>

<p>A. By adding sand mixed with iron filings, water, or sawdust,
according to the degree of increase required.</p>

<p>Q. How should throttling-bar bolts be adjusted?</p>

<p>A. First loosen them slightly, scrape away any paint that
clogs them, and then tighten them to full limit.</p>

<p>Q. What is a priming-charge, and where is it placed?</p>

<p>A. A small charge of black powder in both front and rear of
every section of cartridge.</p>

<p>Q. Should the trunnion-seats of sight-standards be polished?
If not, why not?</p>

<p>A. No. Polishing wears away the brass and throws the sight
out of adjustment. They should be wiped clean, however.</p>

<p>Q. Is the removal of the name-plates or sight-brackets authorized
at any time?</p>

<p>A. No.</p>

<p>Q. How do you test the adjustment of the azimuth indicator?</p>

<p>A. Insert the bore-sights, traverse the gun until the line of
sight through the front and rear bore-sights intersects a datum
point whose azimuth is known. If the indicator reads this
azimuth, the gun is in azimuth.</p>

<p>Q. How do you test the level of a carriage?</p>

<p>A. If the trunnion sight-bracket is correctly adjusted, place
the telescopic sight upon it, set the sight and gun at zero elevation,
and traverse the carriage to the full limits. If the bubble in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
telescope-level remains stationary, the carriage is level. If not,
adjust by turning the leveling-bolts.</p>


<h4>POWDERS, PROJECTILES, PRIMERS, AND FUSES.</h4>

<p>Q. How do you distinguish the following powders: Musket,
sphero-hexagonal,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> brown prismatic, black prismatic, and smokeless.</p>

<p>A. Musket is black and very fine grained. Sphero-hexagonal
is black and in the shape of a small ball with a six-sided ring
around it. Brown prismatic is brown, in the form of a six-sided
prism with a hole in the center. All smokeless powder has the
appearance of translucent celluloid and smells of ether. This
powder grades in size according to the caliber of the gun, and has
for large guns a cylindrical form with small holes running lengthwise
in it. (See Fig. 33.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></p></div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The smokeless powder used in the U. S. Coast Artillery
is made out of ordinary cotton waste. The process of manufacture
is briefly as follows: The cotton waste is first thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
washed, cleaned, picked, and then put through shredding- and
cutting-machines. It is then dried in ovens for many hours. It
is then placed in pots and a mixture of strong nitric and sulphuric
acid is poured over it. It is then washed in running water for
many more hours. It is now called "guncotton." It is then
dissolved with a mixture of alcohol and ether and put under a
hydraulic press. On coming out of the press it looks like yellow
gum. It is then forced through different sized dies, and in this
shape looks like macaroni. It is then cut into various lengths
and sizes, according to the caliber of gun for which it is to be used.</p>

<p>Q. Give the weight of charge, weight of projectile, and initial
velocity of the piece to which your company is assigned.</p>

<p>A. See table on page 75. (Ref. Ordnance Department, G. O.
9, W. D. '08.) Slight variations from the requirements of this
table will be permitted; but it is desired that these requirements
shall be fulfilled as nearly as practicable.</p>

<p>Q. Name the different kinds of primers.</p>

<p>A. Common friction, common electric, obturating friction,
obturating electric, and combination electric friction.</p>

<p>Q. Explain the action of the common friction and the
obturating friction primer.</p>

<p>A. Its action consists in the friction of a saw-tooth wire being
pulled through a portion of mercuric fulminate, which explodes
and ignites a small charge of powder in the primer, which in
turn ignites the main charge in the gun. (See Figs. 34 and 35.)</p>

<p>Q. Explain the action of the common and obturating electric
primer.</p>

<p>A. Two insulated wires entering the primers are joined
by a platinum wire. (A little guncotton is sometimes imbedded
around the platinum wire.) The current heats the platinum,
which ignites a small charge of powder or fulminate, if it be a
common electric, in the primer, which ignites the main charge.
(See Figs. 36 and 37.)</p>

<p>Q. Explain the action of the combination electric friction primer.</p>

<p>A. It is a combination of the two above principles, except that
in the electric feature there is no return wire in the combination
primer. The current comes in through the stem from the copper
contacts on the firing mechanisms, heats the platinum, etc., and
goes out through the case of the primer to the breech-block of
the gun, thence to the trunnion and to the other pole of the firing-battery.
This primer is also <i>obturating</i>. (Fig. 38.)</p>

<p>Q. What is an obturating-primer?</p>

<p>A. One which prevents the escape of powder-gas through
the vent. (It need not necessarily be screwed into the vent.)</p>

<p>Q. What are percussion-primers?</p>

<p>A. Such as are used in fixed ammunition and go off by the
snap of the firing-pin. They are commonly called <i>caps</i>.</p>

<p>Q. What are high- and low-resistance fuses?</p>

<p>A. A high-resistance fuse is one that requires a high initial
velocity to cause the plunger to be released, and is therefore safer
in handling. A low-resistance fuse does not require such a high
initial velocity to cause it to act. Low-resistance fuses are provided
with "safety-wires." (See Fig. 39.)</p>

<p>Q. What fuses are used in the United States service?</p>

<p>A. Frankford Arsenal base percussion, point percussion, and
combination. The first two are of either high or low resistance,
and vary in size for different calibers of guns. All fuses that
are not "centrifugal" have become obsolete for all calibres above
1·65", except the combination fuse, but those on hand will be <i>in
service</i> until used up.</p>

<p>Q. How are fuses inserted to make a tight joint?</p>

<p>A. By putting a special preparation, supplied by the Ordnance
Department, on the threads. <i>Never use red lead.</i></p>

<p>Q. Describe the action of a percussion-fuse and name parts.</p>

<p>A. On firing, the plunger-sleeve is forced to the rear and
remains in this position during flight. On striking, the plunger
and plunger-sleeve are forced forward and the prick-point of the
plunger strikes the fulminate of the fuse; this ignites the priming
charge in the fuse, which ignites the charge in the shell (Fig. 39).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;There is a new fuse now prescribed for our artillery called "The Detonating
Fuse." No one is permitted to take this fuse apart and its construction
is kept secret.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Q. Explain the action of the combination fuse and name parts.</p>

<p>A. Before firing a hole is punched through the hole on the
time-cone corresponding to time of flight at which it is desired
that the projectile burst. On firing, the time-plunger strikes
the firing-pin for the time-train, then the time-train begins to
burn from the point where the hole in the cone was made, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at the end of the time of flight the flame reaches the interior of
the fuse, thence to the shell. If this fails or it be desired to use
the fuse as a percussion-fuse, the action is as in an ordinary
percussion-fuse. Combination fuses are now always made with
the centrifugal arming device as in percussion. (See Figs. 40 and 42.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a delayed-action fuse?</p>

<p>A. One which does not explode until a short time after striking.</p>

<p>Q. Explain the action of the new centrifugal fuse.</p>

<p>A. This fuse can act only when a rotary motion is given to
it. This rotary motion, due to the rotating band, causes the
plunger to bulge away from the center into two parts; when
these parts separate it is seen from Fig. 41 that the firing-pin
takes up a position parallel to the longer axis of the fuse and
its point is almost touching the friction composition. When
the projectile strikes, the plunger drives the firing-pin into the
friction composition. The action is then the same as in the
ordinary percussion-fuse. This fuse is therefore perfectly safe to
handle, transport, or use. It becomes <i>active</i> only when a high
rotary motion is given it. (See Figs. 41 and 42.)</p>

<p>Q. How are drill-primers loaded?</p>

<p>A. Insert a serrated wire with friction-pellet in the body of
the primer, hold it in position with the assembling-tool, screw a
rear wire or bottom wire (depending on whether it is an old- or
new-model vent) fast to the serrated wire, fill with musket-powder,
and close with a brass closing-cup, using the assembling-tool.</p>

<p>Q. Name the different kinds of projectiles in the United
States service.</p>

<p>A. Solid shot, cored shot, shell, shrapnel, and canister. (See
Fig. 43.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the rotating-band and what is its use?</p>

<p>A. The copper band near the base end. It is forced into
the grooves of the rifling and causes the projectile to take up a
rotary motion to prevent tumbling during flight.</p>

<p>Q. Why are some projectiles capped?</p>

<p>A. Experimental tests have shown that it will penetrate
armor-plate deeper than those not capped.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between shrapnel and canister?</p>

<p>A. Shrapnel is composed of a number of spherical balls in a
cast-iron case, of the usual shape of a projectile, and has a bursting-charge
in either the point or the base to scatter these balls.
Canister is in a cylindrical case and has no bursting-charge.
Shrapnel has a point combination fuse and is thus readily distinguished
from all other projectiles. (See Fig. 43.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between cored shot and shell?</p>

<p>A. Cored shot have hollowed centers, as also have shell, but
in the latter the hollow is much larger. Owing to the recent
manufacture of a suitable bursting-charge, cored shot can be
filled with it and used the same as shell.</p>

<p>Q. What is the general color of the main body of all projectiles?</p>

<p>A. Black.</p>

<p>Q. How is the kind of metal of which it is composed marked?</p>

<p>A. By a painted band around the center, half-caliber wide.</p>

<p>Q. How is the degree of armor-piercing capacity marked?</p>

<p>A. By a greater or lesser portion of the head being painted
with the color representing the metal of the projectile.</p>

<p>Q. How is the interior bursting-charge marked?</p>

<p>A. By a distinct color around the base below the rotating-band.</p>

<p>A. With a special varnish furnished by the Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>Q. How are canister painted?</p>

<p>A. Black all over.</p>

<p>Q. How are shrapnel painted?</p>

<p>A. The whole body black, with a band of bright red on the
head below the fuse to indicate front charge, or on the cylindrical
portion of the body in rear of the copper band to indicate base
charge, depending on which class&mdash;base or front charge&mdash;it is.</p>

<p>Q. How are shrapnel distinguished from shell?</p>

<p>A. By the combination point fuse, which is always used with
shrapnel.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by fixed ammunition?</p>

<p>A. That in which the powder-charge and projectile are fixed;
as examples, the ammunition for small-arm pieces and that for
the 6-pdr. R.F. gun (which is made in the same way, only of a
larger size), the powder being contained in a brass case, the projectile
being fastened to the end of the brass case and a percussion-primer
or cap being in the base of the same. (See Fig. 43.)</p>

<p>Q. Name the principal parts of a projectile.</p>

<p>A. The main body, the head, the bourrelet, the point, the base,
and the rotating-band. (See Fig. 43.)</p>

<p>Q. In what kinds of projectiles are fuses used?</p>

<p>A. Shell, cored shot, and shrapnel.</p>

<p>Q. What is the rotating-band made of?</p>

<p>A. Copper.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Recent experiments have shown the superiority of a
wider and heavier band. This new band will in all probability
soon be adopted.</p>

<p>Q. Give some instructions for filling shell.</p>

<p>A. Unscrew and remove the plug from the shell. Place the
filling-rod in the bag and fold the latter round the rod; insert it
through the plug-hole, taking care not to force the end of the rod
through the bottom of the bag; carefully push in the bag until
the neck only is in the plug-hole, a portion being kept outside, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the whole bag must not be allowed to slip into the shell during
the operation of filling; then withdraw the rod and insert the
funnel into the neck of the bag, pressing the funnel well down
into the plug-hole; pass the filling-rod through the funnel and
gradually pour in a small quantity of the powder (say about half
the charge); take out the funnel and rod, lift up the bag and jerk
it, so as to "set" the powder well down to the bottom and to open
the bag; then reinsert the funnel and rod as before, and continue
the filling; choke the bag and cut off the superfluous choke. The
filling-rod should be moved up and down while pouring in the
powder, to facilitate its passage through the funnel, the powder in
the shell being tamped on at the same time. The use of a large
mallet against the side of the shell (any piece of wood will answer
the same purpose) will materially assist in getting the maximum
amount of powder into the shell.</p>

<p>When the shell is quite full withdraw the funnel and filling-rod,
and tie the neck of the bag with two hitches of twine close to
the top of the plug-hole. Cut off the superfluous choke, and push
the neck of the bag well down the plug-hole into the shell, then
screw in the plug as required.</p>

<p>Lead rings are supplied for the armor-piercing shell. The ring
is hammered into the recess round the head of the plug, and the
superfluous metal removed.</p>

<p>No preparation of the bag by pricking or otherwise is
necessary.</p>

<p>Q. Suppose a projectile when weighed on a scale comes to
1044 lbs. and that it has a blue-gray head and a blue-gray band
around its center of gravity, and below the copper band it is painted
yellow; state what gun it is for, what kind of a projectile it is
(whether a shell or solid shot), what it is made of, and if a shell,
what is inside of it.</p>

<p>A. It is an armor-piercing shell for a 12-inch gun; it is made
of forged steel, and is filled with explosive "D."</p>

<p>Q. What are shell and cored shot filled with?</p>

<p>A. Maximite, explosive "D," and rarely gunpowder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Why should shell always be coated carefully with a lacquer
or varnish before being filled?</p>

<p>A. Because some of the explosives now used to fill shell, though
perfectly stable and harmless in themselves, become very sensitive
explosives when exposed to steel or iron. The slightest friction
will sometimes detonate them.</p>

<p>Q. Why is red lead or white lead prohibited on fuse-threads?</p>

<p>A. Because, as with iron, some shell-fillers change into extremely
sensitive explosives on contact with lead.</p>

<p>Q. Why should all fixed ammunition and primers be stored
separately from magazines containing powder?</p>

<p>A. Because they are liable to explode by dropping or breaking,
etc., and the shock of one primer or charge exploding might
explode the whole magazine.</p>

<p>Q. Should rubber shoes be worn in magazines?</p>

<p>A. Yes.</p>

<p>Q. Why?</p>

<p>A. Because there are always priming-charges of black powder
in every section of smokeless powder, and powder-dust from these
might fill the air when opening cases, and a spark from a nail
in a shoe on the concrete floor would ignite it. There is also a
remote chance of the vapor of ether from the new smokeless
powder exploding when in combination with the air.</p>

<p>Rubber matting on magazine floors would be best.</p>

<h4><br />(C) CORDAGE, BLOCKS, TACKLE, GINS, SHEARS, ETC.</h4>

<p>Q. Define yarn, strands, jaws of rope, short- and long-jawed
rope, guys, spun-yarn, marlin, standing rigging, running rigging,
and a bight.</p>

<p>A. Yarn are called threads of hemp or other fibrous material
which compose a rope.</p>

<p>Strand is a number of yarns twisted together.</p>

<p>Jaws of rope are the interstices between the strands of rope.</p>

<p>Short-jawed rope is a rope tightly laid up together.</p>

<p>Long-jawed rope is a rope loosely laid up together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Guys are stationary ropes to hold spars, such as pry-poles,
shears, etc., from falling.</p>

<p>Spun-yarn is made by twisting together very loosely two or
more well-tarred yarns. It is used for serving, seizings, stops,
etc., and is very pliable.</p>

<p>Marlin is also made of tarred yarns, but is tightly twisted and
is much harder and smoother than spun-yarn.</p>

<p>The bight of a rope is any part not an end.</p>

<p>A bight of a rope is formed by bending or doubling the rope
so as to form a loop.</p>

<p>Standing rigging are those ropes which are stationary.</p>

<p>Running rigging are those which run through blocks or pulleys.
(See Figs. 45 and 46.)</p>

<p>Q. Explain the difference between hawser-laid rope and
cable-laid rope.</p>

<p>A. Cable-laid rope is composed of nine strands, and is made
by first laying up three ropes of three strands each with the sun,
and then laying the three ropes together into one, against the
sun. Hawser-laid rope must be coiled with the sun. Hawser-laid
rope is a right-handed rope, and cable-laid is therefore left-handed.
(See Fig. 44.)</p>

<p>Q. How is the size of the rope denoted?</p>

<p>A. The size of the rope is always denoted in inches and
fractions, and is measured on the circumference. (See Fig. 44.)</p>

<p>Q. (<i>a</i>) How do you worm a rope? (<i>b</i>) Why?</p>

<p>A. (<i>a</i>) Worming a rope is filling up the divisions between the
strands by passing spun-yarn along them. (<i>b</i>) This is to render
the surface smooth for parceling and serving. (See Fig. 44.)</p>

<p>Q. (<i>a</i>) How do you parcel a rope? (<i>b</i>) Why?</p>

<p>A. (<i>a</i>) Parceling rope is wrapping narrow strips of canvas
about it, well tarred, put on with the lay of the rope. (<i>b</i>) To
secure it from being injured by rain-water or to prevent chafing
or cutting of a rope when a strain is brought against a rough
surface or sharp edge. (See Fig. 44.)</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Q. (<i>a</i>) How do you serve a rope? (<i>b</i>) Why?</p>

<p>A. (<i>a</i>) Serving is the laying on of spun-yarn or other small
stuff in turns around the rope close together, and hove taut by
the use of a serving-board for small rope and mallet for large
rope. Small ropes are sometimes served without being wormed,
as the crevices between the strands are not large enough to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the surface very uneven. But a large rope is always wormed
and parceled before being served. (<i>b</i>) The service is put on
against the lay of the rope. (See Fig. 44.)</p>

<p>Q. (<i>a</i>) How do you whip a rope? (<i>b</i>) Why?</p>

<p>A. (<i>a</i>) Whipping is securing the end of a rope with twine.
(<i>b</i>) To prevent it from fraying out. (See Fig. 44.)</p>


<h4>KNOTS AND HITCHES.</h4>

<p>Q. Make the following knots and give the use of each:
A square knot, a bowline, single sheet-bend (weaver's knot),
double sheet-bend, rolling hitch, round turn and two half-hitches,
clove-hitch, catspaw, blackwall hitch, sheep-shank, a marlinspike-hitch.</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 45. This figure illustrates the manner of making
these knots. Their uses are as follows:</p>

<p>Square knot: A quick knot to tie two ends of rope together
that will not slip.</p>

<p>Bowline: To form a temporary eye at end of a rope. This
knot can be easily made and remembered by making a marlinspike-hitch
and putting the loose end of the bowline through the
loop where the spike would go.</p>

<p>Single and double sheet-bend: To tie two ropes together.
These knots do not jam. When one rope is smaller than the
other the double sheet-bend is always used, making the double
turn with the smaller rope.</p>

<p>Rolling hitch: For shifting the fall from one end of a windlass
to the other.</p>

<p>Round turn, two half-hitches, and clove-hitch: These are very
useful in securing the guys of a gin to the stakes, etc.</p>

<p>Catspaw: To apply the purchase or tackle to the fall of another.</p>

<p>Blackwall hitch: To fasten the end of a rope to a hook when
there is a steady strain on rope.</p>

<p>Marlinspike-hitch: Very useful in putting on lashings, etc.</p>

<p>Q. What is a strap or sling, and what is its use?</p>

<p>A. A strap or sling is formed by knotting or splicing together the
ends of a short strand of rope. It is used for hooking tackles into.</p>

<h4>SPLICES.</h4>

<p>Q. What is a splice?</p>

<p>A. Splicing is putting the ends of rope together by opening
the strands and placing them one into the other, or by putting
the strands of the rope between those of the bight.</p>

<p>Q. How is an eye-splice made?</p>

<p>A. Unlay the end of the rope for a short distance and lay the
three strands upon the standing part, so as to form an eye. Put
the first end through the strand next to it. Put the second end
over the strand and through the second, and then put the remaining
end through the third strand on the other side of the rope.
Taper them as in the short splice by dividing the strands and
sticking them again. The eye-splice is used to form a permanent
loop in the end of a rope. (See Fig. 48.)</p>

<p>Q. How do you make a short splice?</p>

<p>A. Unlay the strands for a convenient length; take an end
in each hand, place them one within the other, and draw them
close. Hold the end of one rope and the three strands from the
other in the left hand; if the rope is large, stop them down to it
with a rope yarn. Take the middle strand, which is free, pass it
over the strand which is first next to it, then through under the
second and out between the second and third from it, and then
haul it taut. Pass each of the six strands in the same manner,
first those of one end and then those of another. The same
operation may be repeated with each strand, passing each over
the third strand from it, under the fourth and through; or, as is
more usual, after the ends have been stuck once untwist each
strand, divide the yarns, pass one half as above described, and cut
off the other half. This tapers the splice. (See Figs. 45 and 46.)</p>

<p>Q. How do you make a long splice?</p>

<p>A. Unlay the ends of two ropes to a distance three or four
times greater than for a short splice, and place them within
one another as for a short splice. Unlay one strand for a considerable
distance and fill up the interval which it leaves with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
opposite strand from the other rope. Twist the ends of these
two together, then do the same with two more strands. The
two remaining strands are twisted together in the place where
they were first crossed. Open the two last-named strands,
divide in two, take an overhand knot with the opposite halves,
and lead the ends over the next strand and through the second
as the whole strands were passed for the short splice. Cut off
the other two halves. Do the same with the others that are
placed together, dividing, knotting, and passing them in the same
manner. Before cutting off any of the half-strands, the rope
should be well gotten upon a stretch. Sometimes the whole
strands are knotted, then divided, and the half-strands passed
as above described. This splice does not increase the diameter
of the rope, and it is used for splicing a fall or other rope that
runs through blocks. (See Fig. 45.)</p>


<h4>RIGGING-TACKLES.</h4>

<p>Q. What is a tackle?</p>

<p>A. A tackle is a purchase formed by reeving a rope through
one or more blocks for the purpose of hoisting or pulling.</p>

<p>Q. Name the parts of a block.</p>

<p>A. The shell, sheave, pin, and strap. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. Describe the following blocks: Single, double, treble,
snatch, and tail.</p>

<p>A. Single blocks have one sheave; double, two; treble, three.
A tail-block is a single block strapped with an eye-splice and
having a long end by which to make the block fast temporarily.
A snatch-block is a single block having a notch in one cheek to
receive the bight of a fall. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What are the standing parts, the running parts, and the
fall?</p>

<p>A. The standing parts are between the fasts and sheaves, the
running parts between the sheaves, and the fall the part held in
hauling.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the whip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>A. A rope through a single block. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the power gained if the block be fixed?</p>

<p>A. None.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Q. Describe the whip upon whip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>A. The block of one whip is made fast to the fall of another.
(See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the power gained?</p>

<p>A. Double if only one block moves. Quadruple if both move.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the gun-tackle.</p>

<p>A. A rope passed through two single blocks and made fast to
one. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the power gained?</p>

<p>A. Double. Treble if block to which rope is made fast moves.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the luff-tackle.</p>

<p>A. A rope hove through a single and a double block and made
fast to the single block. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the power gained?</p>

<p>A. Treble. Quadruple if the block moves.</p>

<p>Q. What is a luff upon luff?</p>

<p>A. A luff-tackle on the fall of another luff. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. Describe the single Burton.</p>

<p>A. A rope rove through two single blocks, with a hook in the
bight of the running part.</p>

<p>Q. What is the power gained?</p>

<p>A. Treble. Quadruple if both blocks move.</p>

<p>Q. How is power determined when one tackle is applied to
the fall of another?</p>

<p>A. It is equal to the product of their respective powers.</p>

<p>Q. What is mousing, and what is its purpose?</p>

<p>A. A seizing around a hook to prevent it from spreading or
unhooking. (See Fig. 49.)</p>

<p>Q. What is a bight of a hook?</p>

<p>A. The middle of a bend of a hook. (See Fig. 49.)</p>


<h4>GINS.</h4>

<p>Q. Name the different parts of a garrison-gin.</p>

<p>A. It is composed of three poles (two legs and a pry-pole),
braces, a bolt, clevis, windlass, two handspikes, three shoes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a hoisting-apparatus consisting of two blocks (one triple and one
double). (See Fig. 50.)</p>

<p>Q. How much can be safely lifted with it?</p>

<p>A. 17,000 lbs.</p>

</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Q. How can the upper block be placed in
position after the gin has been raised?</p>

<p>A. By rigging a truce rope through the clevis and hoisting it up.</p>

<p>Q. Explain briefly how you would raise a gin.</p>


<h4>SHEARS.</h4>

<p>Q. Describe the parts of the shears.</p>

<p>A. Two spars lashed together at one point, forming an inverted
V, the ends being called heels, the upper end the head,
and the part where the lashing is applied is called the cross.</p>

<p>The equipment consists of the following stores: Two double
blocks, two single blocks for gin-tackles; one double block, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
treble block, and one snatch-block for the main-tackle fall;
guys, head-lashing, heel-lashing, and straps for main tackle;
snatch-block, holdfasts, and some spun-yarn for mousing, etc.;
two cleats for heels to prevent lashing from slipping; stakes for
holdfasts for guys and heel-posts; two shoes for heels. (See Fig.
44.)</p>

<p>Q. What are shears used for?</p>

<p>A. For lifting heavy weights over the face of a wall or cliff,
or in other situations where the gin could not be used for want
of a footing for the pry-pole.</p>

<p>Q. How do you pass a shear-lashing?</p>

<p>A. Middle the lashing and take a turn around both legs
at the cross; pass one end up and the other down, around
and over the cross, until half of the lash is expended;
then ride both ends back again on their own parts and knot
them in the middle; frap the first and riding turns together
on each side with sennit. This will be useful in rigging
shears for hoisting guns when a gin is not available. Any two
spars that will support the weight can be used. (See Fig. 51.)</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<img src="images/i_111.png" width="312" height="350" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span></p></div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lay the middle of the back guy in the cross; bring the left-hand
end up around the right leg and over the head of the left
leg; then carry the right-hand end around under both legs; let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
it cross over the left-hand end, and seize them together with
spun-yarn.</p>

<p>Q. How is a square lashing made?</p>

<p>A. Place two spars at right angles and pass several turns
around two opposite angles of the X, then several turns around
the other two opposite angles. Continue this until the spars are
firmly lashed and will not move; tie the ends. This lashing is
used to make two spars rigid and at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>Q. How are shears rigged and raised?</p>

<p>A. Lay the heads of the spars on a trestle about three feet
high, the right leg above the left, so that they cross at about
twice their thickness from the ends, with the heels in their proper
positions.</p>

<p>Make a bowline-knot in the end of the fore guy and slip it over
the head of both legs.</p>

<p>Lay the middle of the main-tackle strap under the cross above
the fore guy; bring the ends up over the cross; hook the upper
block to them under the cross below the fore guy and mouse it,
taking care that the splice comes in the middle of the strap and
that the fall leads to the rear.</p>

<p>Drive the heel-posts on each side the heels about a foot toward
the head and one foot outside; lay the shoes under the heels;
make a timber-hitch around the inner posts with the heel-lashings;
pass three turns over the legs below the cleats, and hitch
the lashings to the outer posts. Drive four holdfasts for each
back guy, as follows: two on each side the line of the legs prolonged,
three feet apart, and two six feet in the rear of these.</p>

<p>Lay the ends of the guy-straps over the front stakes; connect
each pair of front and rear stakes with a strap twisted up taut
to insure the strain being distributed properly.</p>

<p>Drive two holdfasts for the fore guy, one in the rear of the
other, in the prolongation of the axis of the shears.</p>

<p>Hook the upper blocks of the guy-tackles to a bowline in the
end of the guys, and the single block to the guy-strap, and mouse
them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinarily the fore guy can be worked without a tackle, belaying
it over the holdfasts, first taking a round turn over the one
next the shears. If not too heavy, the shears may be raised by
lifting the head and hauling on the guy-tackles, slacking the
heel-lashings as required, and tending the fore guy carefully to
prevent the shears falling over toward the rear.</p>

<p>Q. How are shears held in position after being raised?</p>

<p>A. By guys and holdfasts.</p>

<p>Q. What is the inclination or rake of the shears with the level
of the ground?</p>

<p>A. About 20 degrees.</p>

<p>Q. How can a change in the direction of the fall of the tackle
be made to lead to a capstan?</p>

<p>A. Hook the snatch-block to a strap placed below the cleat on
either, and pass the fall through it to the capstan.</p>


<h4>HYDRAULIC JACKS.</h4>

<p>Q. For what is the hydraulic jack used?</p>

<p>A. For lifting very heavy weights.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between the base jack and the horizontal
jack?</p>

<p>A. The former has the lever, socket, etc., at the top of the
jack, while the latter has the working parts near the base. (See
Figs. 52 and 53.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the principle involved in hydraulic jacks?</p>

<p>A. A pump operated by hand forces a small amount of alcohol
through a narrow valve into a recess containing a ram or large
piston-rod. As the alcohol is forced into this recess it raises the
ram: thus a weight upon the ram-head is raised. The alcohol is
prevented from running back into the main reservoir by valves
similar to those on all pumps.</p>

<p>Q. What is the best liquid to use in filling jacks?</p>

<p>A. For the base jack one part alcohol, two parts water; for
the horizontal jack one part alcohol, one part water, and for
both add a tablespoonful of sperm-oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Name the principal parts of a jack.</p>

<p>A. The cylinder, ram, reservoir, socket, knuckle, piston,
piston-valve, pump, pump-valve, lowering-valve, packing-springs,
etc. (See Figs. 52 and 53.)</p>

<p>Q. How can a weight be raised when the jack will not go under
the weight?</p>

<p>A. By the use of a movable claw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Give some general instructions for the care and use of the jack.</p>

<p>A. Never fill with water, kerosene, or wood-alcohol. Keep
the ram down when not in use. If the valve sticks on its seat,
strike the lever a few sharp blows up and down, thus jarring the
valve. Use the alcohol supplied by the Ord. Dept.</p>

<p>Base jacks should never be used so that the head is lower than
the foot. A jack should be used once a week to keep the packing
in order.</p>

<p>Never apply more than 150 pounds to the lever: this equals
about the weight of the average man.</p>

<p>Q. How is the rifle cleaned?</p>

<p>A. To clean the barrel, insert in the chamber a cartridge shell,
the front end of which has been filled with a wooden plug, and
close the bolt. Clean the bore with a rag saturated with soda
water, or if this is not obtainable, with water. Wipe dry with
clean rags. Remove the bolt and the cartridge shell, clean and
dry the chamber from the rear. Thoroughly oil the chamber and
the bore with a light coat of cosmoline oil. The stock and hand
guard may be coated with raw linseed oil and polished by rubbing
with the hand.</p>

<h3>EXAMINATION OF FIRST-CLASS GUNNERS.</h3>


<h4>(<i>a</i>) THE AZIMUTH INSTRUMENT AND DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<p>Q. What is an angle?</p>

<p>A. An angle is the divergence of two intersecting lines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 617px;">
<img src="images/i_122.png" width="617" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span></p></div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Fig. 57 the two intersecting lines SA and XA form the
angle SAX, and when measured on the circle with A as the center
it is found to be equal to 80°.45 (eighty and forty-five hundredths
degrees).</p>

<p>Q. Into how many degrees is a circle divided?</p>

<p>A. 360.</p>

<p>Q. How is each degree divided in the U. S. Artillery service?</p>

<p>A. Each degree is divided into one hundred equal parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Define a circle.</p>

<p>A. A circle is a plane figure bounded by a curve, every point
of which is equally distant from a point within called the center.
Fig. 57 represents a circle with <i>A</i> as the center.</p>

<p>Q. What is the vertex of an angle?</p>

<p>A. The point where the two intersecting lines cross. As in
Fig. 57, <i>A</i> is the vertex of the angle <i>SAX</i>.</p>

<p>Q. Define an azimuth angle.</p>

<p>A. It is a horizontal angle measured from zero degrees at the
south in a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by a horizontal angle?</p>

<p>A. One whose intersecting lines or sides are parallel with the
level of water at that point.</p>

<p>Q. What is a vertical angle?</p>

<p>A. One whose sides lie in a plane of a plummet.</p>

<p>Q. Can an azimuth angle be greater than 90°?</p>

<p>A. Yes. See Fig. 51. <i>SAT</i> = azimuth of target (less than
90°); <i>SAT'</i> = azimuth of target (greater than 90°, but less than
180°); <i>SAT''</i> = azimuth of target (greater than 270°). (All these
azimuth angles are read in a <i>clockwise direction</i> from zero at the
south.)</p>

<p>Q. When is a gun or an instrument said to be set in azimuth?</p>

<p>A. When it reads zero and points south.</p>

<p>Q. What is an azimuth-instrument?</p>

<p>A. A device for measuring horizontal angles.</p>

<p>Q. Point out the following parts of the instrument:</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 58.</p>

<p>Q. Describe how to set the azimuth-instrument up for use.</p>

<p>A. First: Set the graduated circle and index-disc to read the
known azimuth of a visible object and clamp (the eccentric-crank
being in gear).</p>

<p>Second: Set the eyepiece slightly to the left of the reading-opening
and tighten the azimuth-clamp.</p>

<p>Third: Raise the whole instrument by grasping the tripod, and
turn it so that the telescope points approximately in the direction
of the visible object whose azimuth is known, being careful to set
the plumb-bob over the home station at the same time and not
destroy the setting of the graduated circle and index-disc.</p>

<p>Fourth: Level the instrument. (This is done by loosening
the azimuth-clamp and setting one level parallel to two opposite
leveling-screws, then turn these two screws either <i>both inward</i>
toward the spindle-head or <i>both outward</i> until the bubble comes
in the middle. Perform the like operation with the other two
leveling-screws and the instrument is level.)</p>

<p>Fifth: Release the azimuth-clamp and set the telescope as
nearly as possible on the object, then clamp and set the vertical
cross-hair exactly by turning the azimuth slow-motion screw.
Verify the setting of the index-disc and the levels. The instrument
is now set in azimuth. Azimuth instruments for mounting
on the parapet have turned on their levelling screws so as to
bring reading opening convenient to the eye.</p>

<p>Q. How is the azimuth of any other point read after the
instrument is set up?</p>

<p>A. By turning the index-disc crank until the vertical hair cuts
the object. Read the even degrees on the graduated circle, and
hundredths of a degree on the index-disc. (In order to make a
considerable change in azimuth-reading, much time is saved by
releasing the eccentric-crank, turning the telescope approximately
on the object, throwing the eccentric-gear again and reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
accurately by turning the index-disc till the vertical hair cuts the
object.)</p>

<p>Q. Why are <i>not</i> azimuth-circles on guns, mortars, etc., always
graduated so that their zeros will <i>point</i> south?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A. If this were always done, the azimuth indicator-plate or
subscale would have to be directly under the muzzle of the gun&mdash;a
very awkward and inconvenient place. These azimuth sub-scales
are therefore placed on the side, and when the gun or mortar
points south the subscale points at zero on the azimuth-circle.</p>

<p>Q. Give some rules for caring for the azimuth instrument.</p>

<p>A. Never allow any of the leveling-screws to become so tight
that they cannot be <i>easily</i> turned by hand. When setting the
instrument up over a concrete floor make little holes in the concrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for the points of the tripod-legs to set in. Never wipe the
lenses with anything having the least sign of dirt or grit upon it.
A perfectly clean chamois is always best. See that all screws are
firmly clamped before putting the instrument away in the wooden
carrying-box. In removing it from the box, pick it up by placing
the hands underneath the worm-gear. Never clamp the instrument
too tightly to the tripod-head. After the instrument is once
leveled avoid jarring or leaning upon it.</p>

<p>Q. In case the azimuth-instrument will not stay level after
performing the usual operation of leveling, how do you adjust the
levels?</p>

<p>A. Set one level parallel with two opposite leveling-screws,
and bring the bubble to the center by turning these two screws
either both inward or both outward. Reverse the telescope
through 180°. If the bubble is not in the center, this level is out
of adjustment. Now correct one half of the error by using the
small steel pin on the little adjusting-screws on the levels, and the
other half by using the two opposite leveling-screws referred to
above. Now turn the telescope 180° again. If it is still out
of level, continue the above method of correction until, on
reversing the telescope, no change in motion of the bubble can
be observed.</p>

<p>Q. Give a rule for finding the least count of a vernier.</p>

<p>A. Divide the value of the smallest division on the limb or
main scale by the number of divisions there are on the vernier.
The result is equal to the least count on the vernier.</p>

<p>Q. How would you focus the telescope.</p>

<p>A. Focus the eyepiece until the cross-wires appear rough.</p>

<p>Then turn the telescope on some distant object and focus the
objective by means of the focusing-knob until the intersection of
the cross-wires remains on the same point, when the eye is moved
up and down and to right and left.</p>

<p>Q. Set up the azimuth instrument over a given point; level,
orient, and focus it.</p>

<p>(This should be practiced frequently.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Examples.</span>&mdash;I. The number of divisions on a vernier = 25.
The value of the smallest division on the main scale = 25 yards.
What is the least reading of the vernier?</p>

<p>
<i>Ans.</i> 25 ÷ 25 = 1 yard.<br />
</p>

<p>II. The value of the smallest division on the main scale of
the mercurial barometer = 1/10 of an inch. The number of divisions
on the vernier = 10. What is the least count of the vernier?</p>

<p>
<i>Ans.</i> 1/10 ÷ 10 = 1/100 of an inch.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The following scheme for accurately counting seconds
has been found valuable to gunners who have no stop-watches; it
is also used by many photographers in timing pictures. When
ready to start to count the time of flight, for example, trail your
gun or instrument on the target, stop traversing, and count to
yourself: One <i>one thousand</i>, two <i>one thousand</i>, three <i>one thousand</i>,
four <i>one thousand</i>, etc., until finished, saying <i>one thousand</i> after
each number. The time required by the average man to say one
<i>one thousand</i> or eight <i>one thousand</i> is equal to one second. With
but little practice a gunner can be trained to count as high as 20
seconds accurately. In such cases stop-watches are not necessary.</p>

<p>Q. Describe how to obtain the range of a target from the
primary or secondary station when the azimuth-angles from the
primary and secondary stations are given to you.</p>

<p>A. First: Set the auxiliary-arm index to read the number of
even degrees the target is from the secondary station, setting
the arm-clamp in the V-shaped notch on the azimuth-circle corresponding
to that number of degrees.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></p></div>
</div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>Second: Set the index-disc to read the hundredths by turning
the index-knob and clamp the index. The auxiliary arm is now
set; therefore the secondary arm is set automatically in azimuth
by virtue of its always remaining parallel to the auxiliary arm.</p>

<p>Third: Set the primary arm to read the number of degrees and
hundredths the target is from the primary station. (The point of
intersection of the fiducial or bevel edges of the primary and
secondary arms is the position of the target on the plotting-board.)</p>

<p>Fourth: Slide the metal intersection-block or "targ" along
the secondary arm until it touches the edge of the primary. The
range in yards can now be readily read on the scales marked on
these arms. (Fig. 62.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. How are the range and azimuth for the directing-gun
obtained for the same target?</p>

<p>A. Move the gun-arm up to the intersecting edge of the targ,
and read the range from the scale on the gun-arm. The degrees
of azimuth are read through the reading-opening, and the hundredths
are read on the index-disc for the gun-arm.</p>

<p>Q. Suppose the range must be corrected for, say, 150 yards
more, and the azimuth for 1·78 degrees less, how can the corrected
range and corrected azimuth be automatically read on the
gun-arm?</p>

<p>A. Turn the pinion on the gun-arm to move the scale of the
range correction-device until 2150 is set. (The <i>zero</i> of this scale
= 2000.) (By doing this it is readily seen that the gun-arm range-scale
is just 150 yards <i>nearer</i> the gun center; consequently all ranges
read on this scale will be 150 yards more than if the range correction-device
were at zero.) The azimuth correction is set by
turning the micrometer until the number of even degrees of the
azimuth correction (in this case one degree less) is read on the
main scale, and the hundredths on the micrometer. (Thus it is
seen that the gun-arm will read as many degrees and
hundredths more or less than the true azimuth as the
number of degrees and hundredths of the azimuth correction
determined.)</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Having determined by the ballistic board the range
and azimuth corrections, they will usually answer for some time
and thus avoid continual setting of these corrections on the
gun-arm.</p>

<p>Q. What is the object of the travel-devices for range and
azimuth correction on the gun-arm?</p>

<p>A. These are to determine the amount of change of
range and azimuth between each observation of the target.
The results thus obtained are given to the range- and deflection-board
operators, who use it in finding the total range
correction and the total azimuth correction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. What are all plotting-boards principally used for?</p>

<p>A. For finding the position of a target whereby the range
and the azimuth of it from any other point (as a directing-gun
of a battery) can be determined.</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by the scale of a plotting-board?</p>

<p>A. By the scale of a plotting-board is meant, one inch on
the board is equal to one, two, or so many yards on the
ground; e.g., a scale of "one inch equals 300 yards" means,
one inch distance on the board equals 300 yards on the
ground.</p>

<p>Q. How can you determine the distance between two points
on a plotting-board?</p>

<p>A. By using the range-arm that is constructed for the scale
to which the board is drawn, setting the zero on one point and
reading the number of yards on the arm where the point cuts
the scale-edge.</p>

<p>Q. How is the longitudinal deviation measured on the plotting-board?</p>

<p>A. Measure the distance from the gun to the target, and from
the gun to the splash. Subtract the lesser from the greater, and
this will be the longitudinal deviation, according to the meaning
given in drill regulations.</p>

<p>Q. How is the lateral deviation measured?</p>

<p>A. Read the azimuth of the target and splash from the directing-gun.
Subtract the lesser from the greater: result = lateral
deviation. If the azimuth to the target be greater than that
to the splash, it is seen that the deviation will be to the left and
<i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Q. How are open sights on rapid-fire guns used?</p>

<p>A. The same as on small-arm pieces; i.e., the range in yards
or elevation in degrees and minutes is set on the rear sight according
to how the sight is graduated, and the gun is elevated and
traversed until the target, front sight, and rear sight all come
in line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Describe the 5" R.F. sight.</p>

<p>A. It consists of a sight-bar graduated in degrees and minutes
(lowest reading being six minutes), with a sliding scale at the top
for deflection right or left, the deflection-scale reading to three
minutes. A range-drum is also geared to the sight-bar, and
moves with it in such a manner that when the piece has a certain
elevation it will shoot to a distance equal to the range on
the drum. This avoids using any range-table.</p>

<p>Q. Describe the 6-pdr. R.F. sight.</p>

<p>A. A simple bar-sight graduated to yards with a deflection-scale
reading to three minutes.</p>

<p>Q. How is the deflection-scale set on open sights when it is
desired to fire to right or left?</p>

<p>A. To fire right, move the peep-hole to the right; to fire left,
move the peep-hole to the left.</p>

<p>Q. From what line is all elevation measured?</p>

<p>A. From the axis of the bore. (See Fig. 63.)</p>

<p>Q. Define sight elevation.</p>

<p>A. The angle between the axis of the bore before firing and
the line of sight. (See Figs. 63 and 64.)</p>

<p>Q. In case shot strikes to the right or left, and as gunner you
had the sight on the target when the shot struck, how could you
correct your error with a telescopic sight or open sights?</p>

<p>A. Stopping traversing at the instant shot strikes, move the
vertical hair rapidly to the splash. The sight is now corrected
for the error, and its setting will be correct for the next shot.</p>

<h4>ADJUSTMENT.</h4>

<p>Adjust the ruler by means of the adjusting-screw on the left,
so that its upper edge coincides with the parallel lines on the board.</p>


<h4>OPERATION.</h4>

<p>The bar is clamped by means of the screw near the left end of
the ruler.</p>

<p>The bar must be held firmly while moving the trammel. In
making corrections for artillery fire the following data, as obtained
at the opening of the action, will usually suffice for the entire action.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Density of the air</i>,<br />
<i>Velocity of the wind</i>,<br />
<i>Azimuth of the wind</i>,<br />
<i>Height of tide</i>.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The range effects and deviating effects of the wind must be
obtained for each shot. Tide should be changed at least every
half-hour. As soon as the density of the air is ascertained the
computer will insert a pin, or set the pointer at the top of the
corresponding curve. The same will be done for height of tide.</p>

<p>The muzzle velocity to be used for the first shot will be marked
in a similar manner as directed by the range officer. The wind-component
device having been set for the azimuth and velocity
of the wind and the azimuth of the target, the computer will note
the reference-number and set the pointer at the top of the wind-curve
having that number.</p>

<p>As soon as he receives the travel reference-number he will
set the string accordingly, using the scale for the <i>observing interval</i>
used.</p>

<p><i>To determine correction.</i>&mdash;As soon as the approximate range is
received, the computer sets the ruler for the range and the index
at zero; he then slides the trammel to the left until the pointer
is opposite the atmosphere curve as indicated by the pointers <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>,
<i>g</i>, etc., holding the bar in place with the left hand. He then slides
the bar until the pointer is at normal for atmosphere; this completes
the correction for atmosphere.</p>

<p>He then proceeds in the same manner for <i>wind</i> and <i>tide</i>,
always sliding the trammel until the pointer is at the indicated
curve, holding the bar in place with the left hand and then sliding
the bar until the pointer is at normal.</p>

<p>If the muzzle velocity is normal, no correction is made for
velocity. If, however, the muzzle velocity is not normal, he
makes a correction for muzzle velocity in a similar manner as for
other data.</p>

<p>The above corrections are made before the travel is received.
The computer clamps the bar and then waits until he receives the
travel.</p>

<p>As soon as the travel is received, he sets the string, slides
trammel until the pointer is opposite the string, unclamps the bar
and moves it until the pointer is opposite the normal; this adds
the correction for travel during the time of flight.</p>

<p>He then notes the total travel during the observing interval,
which is indicated by the position of the string on the travel-scale
corresponding to the observing interval used. He slides the
trammel so that the pointer will be at the vertical line corresponding
to the total travel during the observing interval, and then
slides the bar to the normal; this adds the travel during the
observing interval. He now clamps the bar. <i>The register now
indicates the total correction to be applied to the arm.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Trial-shots.</i>&mdash;The gun is laid so that the shot should have a
certain range, all corrections having been determined as described
above, except of course that for travel.</p>

<p>The bar is set with the index at zero, and the trammel is set
at the muzzle velocity used in the computation for the shot.</p>

<p>The gun is fired and the range of the shot is plotted. The
range officer determines how much the shot has fallen short or
gone beyond, and announces the result as plus or minus so many
yards. The computer moves the bar plus or minus the number
of yards announced, using the scale for this purpose.</p>

<p>The pointer now indicates the muzzle velocity to be used in
computing the next shot. The velocity pointer is moved accordingly.</p>

<p>If a second trial shot is used, the corrections are computed as
before, using, however, the new muzzle velocity as determined
from the first shot.</p>

<p>In determining a second corrected muzzle velocity the bar
should be moved for but half the longitudinal deviation of the
shot from the expected range; the pointer then marks the velocity
to be used for the next shot.</p>

<p>In case a third trial shot is used the process is the same except
that the bar is moved for but one third of the longitudinal deviation.</p>

<p>The curves are given for every ten yards of range, for every
ten per cent of weight of air, and for every ten miles of wind, etc.</p>

<p>For conditions in which the values lie between these readings,
the trammel can readily be set by the eye sufficiently close for all
practical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. How do the divisions on the azimuth-subscale and the
deflection-scale of the sights compare with one another?</p>

<p>A. They are equal&mdash;the least reading on the former = 5
hundredths, and on the sight-scale one point or division = 5
hundredths or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Q. How are the predicted range and predicted azimuth obtained?</p>

<p>A. It is now, under the new system of fire direction, obtained
by means of the travel correction on the range correction and
azimuth correction-board. If these new boards are not yet
issued, the use of a range-keeper's range prediction-scale and
a gunner's azimuth prediction-scale determines them at the gun.
The old method was by plotting several positions of a target
on the plotting-board and using a prediction-ruler, whence the
<i>predicted point</i> was obtained.</p>

<p>Q. Define quadrant elevation.</p>

<p>A. The angle between the axis of the bore before firing and
the horizontal plane. (See Figs. 63 and 64.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between quadrant and sight elevation?</p>

<p>A. Where the gun is above the target, sight elevation equals
quadrant elevation plus the angular depression of the target.
Where the gun is below the target, sight elevation equals quadrant
elevation minus the angular elevation of the target.</p>

<p>Q. How is the gunner's quadrant used?</p>

<p>A. It is used principally in giving elevation to mortars by
first setting the movable arm such that the knife-edged tooth
engages in an even-degree mark on the rack, and by moving the
sliding level to read the exact number of minutes. Then it is
placed on its seat at the breech, being careful to see that the
arrow points in the direction of the line of fire, and by elevating
or depressing the piece until the bubble comes in the middle the
mortar or piece will be set at the elevation set on the quadrant.

<p>Q. How is deflection set on it?</p>

<p>A. By moving the deflection-screw the vertical cross-wire
moves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. How is deflection set to fire right and to fire left?</p>

<p>A. Move the vertical hair to the right to fire left, move it to
the left to fire right, by turning the deflection-screw.</p>

<p>Q. How is elevation set on it?</p>

<p>A. Set the zero of the vernier opposite the mark on the limb
representing the number of even degrees of the given elevation.
Then turn the micrometer-disc by turning the elevation-screw
until the given number of minutes is read on it. The sight is
then set on the trunnion-bracket and the piece elevated till the
bubble comes in the middle for quadrant elevation or till the
horizontal cross-hair cuts the water line of target for sight elevation.
The gun then has the elevation set on the sight.</p>

<p>Q. What is the lowest reading of the vernier on the elevation-arc?</p>

<p>A. Two minutes.</p>

<p>Q. What is the lowest reading of the deflection-scale?</p>

<p>A. Three minutes.</p>

<p>Q. Why is it necessary to elevate the gun till the bubble on
the telescope-level comes in the middle, to set the gun for quadrant
elevation?</p>

<p>A. Because by definition quadrant elevation is the angle
between the axis of the bore and the horizontal plane, and when
the bubble is in the center of the level the telescope is horizontal
and the axis of the gun makes an angle with it equal to the elevation
set on the arc.</p>

<p>Q. Name and point out the following parts of the rapid-fire
sight: Telescope, objective, eyepiece, interior and exterior deflection-scales,
micrometer-head, deflection-screw, open sights, dew-cap,
lugs, and thumb-screws.</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 70.</p>

<p>Q. What is one point on the deflection-scale equal to at the
target?</p>

<p>A. One five-hundredth of the range in yards; thus one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
point equals 2 yards at 1000 yards, 4 yards at 2000 yards, and
so on.</p>

<p>Q. <span class="smcap">Example</span>: The range is 5000 yards, and the drift for that
range is found in the range-table to be 12 minutes; how would
you set your deflection-scale on the telescopic sight?</p>

<p>A. "<i>Fire left</i>" 12 minutes, or 4 points.</p>

<p>Q. Why?</p>

<p>A. Because drift in our service is always to the right, and to
overcome this drift and make the projectile hit the target we
will have <i>to fire to the left</i> this 12 minutes due to drift.</p>

<p>Q. <span class="smcap">Example</span>: The range is 5000 yards, and the component
of the wind perpendicular to the line of fire is 20 miles, giving
from the range-table correction for drift equal to 12 minutes and
wind 6 minutes. The wind is blowing from right to left. How
would you set your sight?</p>

<p>A. "<i>Fire left</i>" 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Q. Why?</p>

<p>A. Because, as shown above, the drift alone would require
the sight to be set at "<i>Fire left</i>" 12 minutes, and if the wind correction
is 6 minutes and is blowing from right to left, to overcome
this wind and make the projectile hit the target we would have
to "<i>Fire right</i>" 6 minutes. Therefore, if the total setting of
the sight is to be "<i>Fire left</i>" 12 minutes plus "<i>Fire right</i>" 6
minutes, the final or resultant setting should be "<i>Fire left</i>" 6
minutes.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The corrections for wind and drift are usually found
at the same time from a chart, correction-board, or table.</p>

<p>Q. <span class="smcap">Example</span>: The time of flight is 10 seconds (this is found
from the gun commander's range-table, knowing the range);
how would you determine the correction for travel with a telescopic
sight?</p>

<p>A. Set the sight at zero. Traverse the gun until the vertical
hair cuts the target. Signal: "Stop traversing," and count the
number of seconds time of flight (10), moving by the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
hand the deflection-screw, to keep the vertical hair on the target.
When 10 seconds are counted stop turning the deflection-screw.
Where the vertical hair now rests is the correction for "travel
during time of flight." Since to "<i>Fire left</i>" we move the vertical
hair to the <i>right</i>, this correction for travel found will have
to be set for "<i>Fire left</i>," or on the other side of the scale, if the
target is moving from <i>right</i> to <i>left</i>. If it is moving from <i>left</i> to
<i>right</i>, the correction found will have to be set "<i>Fire right</i>." In
other words, always set the cross-hair in the opposite direction
from the motion of the vessel in making the correction for travel.
This also applies to open sights.</p>

<p>Q. <span class="smcap">Example</span>: If you were given the range, a gun commander's
range-table, a correction for wind and drift equal to "<i>Fire
left</i>" 9 minutes, and the target were moving from right to left,
how would you proceed to determine the setting of your sight?</p>

<p>A. First, determine by the above method the correction for
travel during time of flight (time of flight being found in the gun
commander's range-table). Set this on the sight. Suppose it
were "<i>Fire left</i>" 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Second, use this position of the vertical hair as a new zero,
and move the vertical hair to "<i>Fire left</i>" 12 minutes. That is,
"<i>Fire left</i>" 3 minutes plus "<i>Fire left</i>" 9 minutes equals "<i>Fire
left</i>" 12 minutes.</p>

<p>If the travel had been "<i>Fire right</i>" 3 minutes, then by moving
the scale "<i>Fire left</i>" 9 minutes, the final setting of the sight would
have been "<i>Fire left</i>" 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Q. From the table on page 129 find the number of yards
3 points on the telescopic sight are equal to at 7000 yards
range.</p>

<p>A. 18 yards.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;This table is only <i>approximate</i>. It is true within 1
yard, which is sufficiently accurate for all firing under Case II.</p>

<p>Q. Where is the sight placed under cases one, two, and three?</p>

<p>A. On the trunnion for case one, to give both elevation and
direction. On the sight standard for case two, to give direction
only (quadrant elevation is set by the elevating-arc). It is not
intended to be used at all in case three, but, of course, it could
where the quadrant elevation is to be set by the sight instead
of by the elevation-arc. It will then have to be placed on the
trunnions.</p>

<p>Q. Define cases one, two, and three.</p>

<p>A. Case one, where direction and elevation are given by the
sight on the trunnion. Case two, where direction is given by the
sight, and elevation by the quadrant or elevating-arc. Case
three, where direction is given by the azimuth-circle, and elevation
by the quadrant or arc.</p>

<p>Q. What is the difference between the axis of the bore and
the line of departure?</p>

<p>A. The jump. (See Fig. 63.)</p>

<p>Q. What is the line of sight?</p>

<p>A. Line joining the target, the point of the front sight and
the peep of the rear sight; or with telescopic sights, the line joining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the target and the intersection of the vertical and horizontal
hairs in the sight. (See Fig. 63.)</p>

<p>Q. Define time of flight.</p>

<p>A. The time it takes the projectile to leave the bore till it
strikes.</p>

<p>Q. What is a <i>tangent</i>?</p>

<p>A. A straight line which touches but one point on the circumference
of a circle and is perpendicular to the radius at that point.</p>

<p>Q. Define angle of fall.</p>

<p>A. It is the angle which the tangent to the trajectory at the
point of impact makes with a line parallel to the line of sight at
this point.</p>

<p>Q. What is the line of departure?</p>

<p>A. The prolonged axis of the bore at the moment the projectile
leaves the muzzle.</p>

<p>Q. What is the line of fire?</p>

<p>A. The prolonged axis of the bore before the gun is fired.</p>

<p>Q. What is the axis of the bore?</p>

<p>A. The line passing through the centre of the bore from breech
to muzzle.</p>

<p>Q. What is the angle of departure?</p>

<p>A. The angle included between the <i>line of departure</i> and the
horizontal plane.</p>

<p>Q. Define drift.</p>

<p>A. It is the deviation due to the rifling in the gun to the right
or left of the vertical plane passing through the axis of the bore,
or plane of fire. It is always to the right in the U. S. service.</p>

<p>Q. To what in a telescopic sight does the front sight on an
open sight correspond?</p>

<p>A. The intersection of the cross-hairs.</p>

<p>Q. To what does the rear sight correspond?</p>

<p>A. The eye-lens.</p>

<p>Q. What is the trajectory?</p>

<p>A. The path of the projectile in the air.</p>

<p>Q. How is the velocity of the wind determined?</p>

<p>A. By the anemometer. First take the reading of the discs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
on the anemometer and note the time. After six minutes have
elapsed read the scales. Take the difference of the scales and
multiply by 10, which gives the velocity. (See Fig. 73.)</p>

<p>For example: Suppose at 10:05 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the reading is 62 miles,
and at 10:11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the reading is 63 miles. If in six minutes it
goes one mile, in sixty minutes it will go ten times, or ten miles
per hour.</p>

<p>Fourth: From this same point on the little lever-arm run a
pencil along the nearest line parallel to the arrow, and where it
intersects the diameter of the disc perpendicular to the arrow is
read the component in the direction of deflection or the lateral
component.</p>

<p>Q. What is a difference chart?</p>

<p>A. One that determines the differences in azimuth and range
between the directing-gun and the gun for which it is constructed.
It consists of a board having drawn on it circles of different
diameters, which are the azimuth difference circles (the amounts
being written on each circle). (See Fig. 77.)</p>

<p>Q. How is it used?</p>

<p>A. First: Set the range-arm on the given azimuth.</p>

<p>Second: Run the finger to the given range on the range-arm.</p>

<p>Third: The azimuth difference is read on the nearest circle that
cuts the point where the finger last rests, and the range difference
is read on the scale in red ink along the azimuth circle of the
board. (See Fig. 77.)</p>

<p>Q. What is meant by muzzle velocity?</p>

<p>A. The number of feet per second a projectile is moving at the
time it leaves the muzzle of the gun. It is also called Initial Velocity.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Atmosphere-board.</span></h4>

<p>Q. Describe the atmosphere-board.</p>

<p>A. This is merely a graphic table by means of which the
reference-numbers to be recorded on the atmosphere-aeroscope
indicator can be determined from the readings of the barometer
and thermometer. The arguments are barometer and thermometer
readings, and the reference-numbers are indicated by diagonal
lines. The thermometer axis is horizontal and the barometer
axis is vertical. To increase the ease and rapidity of reading
the barometer scale is graduated on a movable T square.</p>

<p>The method of construction is shown in Fig. 79.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i>&mdash;Set the T square for the thermometer reading and
note the diagonal line which intersects the fiducial edge of the T
square the nearest to the barometer reading. The atmosphere
dial is graduated to &frac12; per cent. The reading of the board should
be taken to the nearest half reference-number.</p>

<h4>SPECIAL APPARATUS FOR MORTARS.</h4>

<p>Q. Point to the following parts of the Mortar Gun-arm:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Movable gun-arm.<br />
Yards range.<br />
Overlap.<br />
Elevations.<br />
Time of flight.<br />
Zones.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A. See Fig. 80.</p>


<h4>SET-FORWARD RULER.</h4>

<p>Q. Describe the set-forward ruler and explain its use.</p>

<p>A. First find the travel in yards per minute. Set the pointer
(<i>a</i>) on the slide (<i>b</i>) at the number of yards on the scale of "yards
travel per minute (<i>c</i>)." Then on gun-arm get time of flight for
that point. The "set-forward point" will be the reading opposite
time of flight on the scale of "yards travel during time of flight +1
minute (<i>d</i>)." (See Fig. 81.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;After taking four observations on a target we find
that in one minute's time it has traveled 200 yards. Set the
pointer (<i>a</i>) at 200 yards on the scale (<i>c</i>). On the gun-arm we
see that the time of flight for this point is sixty seconds. Therefore
our set-forward point is 400 yards, as this is the reading exactly
opposite the time of flight on scale (<i>d</i>). (See Fig. 81.)</p>

<p>Q. Describe and explain the use of the prediction scale.</p>

<p>A. The prediction scale is graduated in the same manner as
the gun-arm (1" = 300 yards), and is used for finding the <i>predicted
point</i>. After having marked four points on the board,
showing the course of the target, place the prediction scale so
that zero (0) is on the last point, or reading, and then mark off
as many yards in advance of the last point as the first reads from
zero. This point is known as the predicted point, and is used
by the range officer only. As soon as the predicted point is
found he sets his azimuth instrument at the given azimuth and
when the target crosses the vertical wire in the instrument, he
gives the signal "Fire." (See Fig. 82.)</p>

<h4>DEFLECTION SCALE.</h4>

<p>Q. Describe the deflection scale and explain its use.</p>

<p>A. The deflection scale is used to determine azimuth corrections
for mortars. After the "set-forward point" has been
obtained, the plotter sets the gun-arm on it and by means of the
<i>indicator</i> determines the zone, range, and elevation of the target.
The operator reads the straight azimuth from the gun-azimuth
scale and gets the zone and elevation from the plotter. He then
sets the elevation scale-pointer at the given elevation, turns crank
moving small azimuth pointer to the azimuth he obtained from
gun-arm scale; then by referring to the large azimuth scale-pointer
he reads the corrected gun-azimuth, which he sends to
the pits together with zone and elevation. Should it become
necessary to make a correction for drift, turn the deflection-scale
knob, either to right or left, as the case may be, as 3 = normal.
(See Fig. 83.)</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;This apparatus depends upon the fact that the drift
is the same for the same elevation in every zone except the eighth.
In this zone the instrument cannot be used as now constructed.</p>

<p>Q. What vessels are unarmored?</p>

<p>A. Gunboats, torpedo-boats and destroyers.</p>

<p>Q. What is the best part of a ship to attack at long range?</p>

<p>A. The decks.</p>

<p>Q. What part should rapid-fire guns attack at short range?</p>

<p>A. Sides, ends, and small turrets, and guns protected only
with shields. These rules, however, may vary with height of
battery, form of attack, and class of ships attacking.</p>

<p>Q. How are ships of the U. S. Navy distinguished, knowing
their names? (See Fig. 86.)</p>

<p>A. Battle-ships are generally named after States (except the
Kearsarge), cruisers after large cities, gunboats after historical
cities as a rule, coast-defense monitors have Indian names, torpedo-boats
and torpedo-boat destroyers are named after heroes
of wars. (The above rules have a few exceptions.)</p>

<p>Q. From the silhouettes on Fig. 86, Ships of the U. S. Navy,
find a battle-ship, a high-speed cruiser, a gunboat, a coast-defense
monitor.</p>

<h3>EXAMINATION FOR TORPEDO-COMPANY GUNNERS.</h3>

<h4>SECOND-CLASS GUNNERS.</h4>


<div class="center"><i>Ammunition, Nomenclature, and Service of Piece.</i></div>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In the following series of questions and answers the
new and adopted system only is included.</p>

<p>Q. What guns are usually assigned to torpedo companies?</p>

<p>A. R. F. guns, principally 3-inch.</p>

<p>Q. Give a rough outline of the general operation of the system
of submarine mines.</p>

<p>A. A submarine mine is a ball-shaped iron case filled with
high explosive. Several of these are <i>planted</i> across a channel and
held below the surface of the water by heavy anchors. From
each mine is run a single-core cable. All these cables join the
wires of a multiple-core cable which runs to the "mining casemate."
In this building are electrical devices for firing the
mine either when it is struck by the enemy's ship (called "contact-firing,")
or at the mine-commander's will ("observation-firing").
This firing is accomplished by sending an electric
current through the cable to the mine. Inside the mine is an
electric fuse. The return-circuit is by ground. (The details of
electrical and engineering features and wiring are not required
of a second-class gunner.)</p>

<p>Q. What ammunition is used in the 3-inch R. F. gun?</p>

<p>A. A cartridge case of solid drawn brass about 23 inches long
containing a powder charge in the base of 5 pounds of smokeless
and a projectile weighing 15 pounds in the top. Armor-piercing
shell and shrapnel are also used. The saluting charge weight,
2 pounds.</p>

<p>Q. What primer is used?</p>

<p>A. The Frankford Arsenal 110-grain igniting. (See No. 2,
Fig. 97.)</p>

<p>Q. Name the principal parts of this primer.</p>

<h4>POSTS.</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Chief of detachment, 2 yards to the right of the carriage,
facing it.</p>

<p>Gun-pointer, immediately in rear of the shoulder piece,
facing to the front.</p>

<p>No. 1, 2 feet to the right and rear of the breech facing it.</p>

<p>No. 2, 2 feet to the left and rear of the breech facing it.</p>

<p>No. 3, on the right of the gun, near the elevating clamp,
facing to the front.</p>

<p>No. 4, 3 feet in rear of the breech facing it.</p>

<p>No. 5, near the ammunition recess, facing the gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The posts of the gun detachment as given above are for inspection
and preparatory to the service of the gun.</p>

<p>The men resume their posts on the completion of any duty
requiring them elsewhere.</p>

<p>The chief of detachment and gun-pointer go wherever their
presence is necessary.</p>

<p>Q. Give the duties of the gun commander, chief of detachment,
and gun-pointer.</p>

<p>A. <i>The gun commander</i> indicates the target, repeats the commands
"Commence firing" and "Cease firing," announces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
kind of projectile to be used, the order of fire, and, in restricted
fire, the number of shots and the firing interval. He is responsible
to the battery commander for the condition of the material and
the efficiency of the personnel of his command, sees that the guns,
magazines, equipments, and implements are properly secured
after the day's drill.</p>

<p><i>The chief of detachment</i> is responsible that the gunner identifies
the target. He is particularly charged with seeing that his piece
is properly loaded and that the precautions for safety in case of
misfires are carried out. At the command "Cease firing" he
will cause the breech to be opened.</p>

<p><i>The gun-pointer</i> is responsible for the proper regulation of the
current for the lights of the night sights. He adjusts the sight
in its seat and sets the elevation and the deflection scales for the
indicated range and deflection. He aims the gun and fires as
soon after the command "Ready" as the piece is aimed. He
will observe the splash of his shots if possible and when necessary
make the proper correction on his sight. In connection with the
gun commander he determines the deflection correction for travel
of target, using the deflection scale for the purpose.</p>

<p>Q. Give the duties of the members of the detachment for
loading and firing.</p>

<p>A. <i>The chief of detachment</i> indicates the target and range and
commands: 1. <i>No</i>. &mdash;, 2. <i>With</i> (such projectile), 3. <i>Commence
firing</i> (or, so many rounds, <i>commence firing</i>).</p>

<p>He repeats the command <i>cease firing</i>.</p>

<p>After the first round the projectile is named only when a
different kind is ordered and the gun is loaded without command
immediately after it is fired.</p>

<p><i>The gun-pointer</i>, when the gun has the proper elevation,
commands and signals <i>clamp</i>. He fires by lanyard and in
simulated firing calls out <i>fire</i> when he pulls the lanyard, as a signal
to load.</p>

<p><i>No. 1</i> opens the breech, closes it as soon as the cartridge
is inserted, and calls out <i>ready</i> as soon as he is clear of the recoil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>(If there is any difficulty in opening or closing the breech, he
examines the threads of the <i>breech-block</i>, wipes off any dirt found,
and oils the mechanism.)</p>

<p><i>No. 2</i> receives a round of ammunition from No. 5 and inserts
it in the chamber.</p>

<p>(If there is difficulty in opening or closing the breech, he
examines the threads of the <i>breech recess</i>, wipes off any dirt
found, and oils the threads if they become dry.)</p>

<p><i>No. 3</i> clamps the gun in elevation at the gun-pointer's command
and unclamps immediately after the gun is fired.</p>

<p><i>No. 4</i> receives the empty cartridge case as it is ejected and
lays it aside.</p>

<p><i>No. 5</i> brings a round of ammunition of the designated kind
from the recess and passes it to No. 2.</p>


<h4>MATERIAL AND DUTIES OF THE LOADING-ROOM.</h4>

<div class="center">(Except electrical principles involved.)</div>

<p>Q. What apparatus is used in making a Turk's head?</p>

<p>A. A navy knife and tool-box "D" is required. Besides the
tools the box should be equipped with a supply of Turk's head
collars and marline.</p>

<p>Q. What is used in making a telegraph-joint?</p>

<p>A. A pair of pliers, navy knife, and, where insulation is
desired, okonite tape.</p>

<p>Q. What is used in making a joint to be used under water?</p>

<p>A. A navy knife, tool-box "D," junction-boxes in which to
clamp the Turk's heads, and the material for making okonite
joints or the cores. These materials are, okonite tape, cement,
Manson tape and tin-foil. A torch is needed for vulcanizing
the joint. Brass jointers are sometimes used in making the
joints.</p>

<p>Q. Point out all the parts of an assembled mine.</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 98.</p>

bursting-charge; set-screw for fuse-can; lead or graphite gasket
for same; rubber packing; brass washers; fuse-can cap; lower
tube set-screw; gland; lower tube; plug proper; loading-wire.</p>

<p>Q. Name some of the duties in the loading-room.</p>

<p>A. Loading mines with explosives; assembling them complete
to the single-core cable; preparing compound plugs, cables, and
raising-ropes; in other words, preparing a mine for planting in
the harbor, except attaching the anchor and mooring-rope.</p>

<p>Q. Make a telegraph-joint.</p>

<p>A. See Figs. 99 and 100.</p>

<p>Q. Make a Turk's head.</p>

<p>A. See Fig. 101. Trim the ends square: 15 inches from it
place a wrapping of a few turns of marline overlapping each other
and secured by a square knot. Slip on the collar, flat side against
the stop of the marline; bend the iron wires back over the collar
and cut off 4 inches from one and 6 inches from the next, alternately.
Bend the wires with the pliers as so to closely fit and
crimp the collar. Beginning at the Turk's head, wrap closely
with marline so as to bind the wires to the cable. The jute
covering and serving maybe bent back over the wires, or it may be
cut off: in cutting turn the edge of the knife away from the cable.</p>

<p>Q. Make a taped joint, place it in salt water for 30 minutes
and test.</p>

<p>A. This will have to be learned by practice and constant
instruction at the loading-room.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The transformer, fuse, can, etc., on the compound
plug are still in a state of experimentation and no method for the
assembling of the latest design has been adopted as yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. How do you test the transformer?</p>

<p>A. With a circuit detector or galvanometer and a dry cell,
as shown in figure.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In case of a break in the coil, Fig. 102, there would be
no current flowing in galvanometer and no deflection of the needle
would be indicated.</p>

<p>The wires that should show <i>closed</i> circuit are the two red wires
and the black wire and transformer case. Those that should be
<i>open</i> are the black, and either red wire. (See Fig. 102.)</p>

<p>Q. How are fuses tested?</p>

<p>A. With a dry cell and a circuit detector. A closed-circuit
test is all that is necessary. This should always be done under
the supervision of an experienced electrician.</p>

<p>Q. What apparatus is used in preparing a compound plug
complete?</p>

<p>A. Bench vise, S-wrench, large monkey wrench, screw driver,
small pliers, navy knife, loading wire, cotton-braided wire,
priming charge, fuses, rubber packings, brass washers, followers,
lead washers, set screws, red lead or ruberine, circuit detector,
brass jointers, rubber tape.</p>

<p>Q. What is the method of numbering mines?</p>

<p>A. Facing in the direction of the expected approach of the
enemy's ships, mines are numbered from left to right, beginning
with No. 1.</p>

<p>Q. How are groups numbered?</p>

<p>A. In the same manner. No. 1 group on the left, No. 2 next
toward the right, etc.</p>

<p>Q. How are the mooring-ropes prepared, and what are the
rules for length of mine cables and of mooring-ropes?</p>

<p>A. The mooring-cables are cut off with square ends and the
ends passed through the holes in the mooring-sockets. The
strand and wires are untwisted and spread out for a length equal to
the length of the socket-hole. The rope is then pulled back until
the loose ends are about flush with the top edge of the hole; a piece
of marline is tied about the rope below the socket. If necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
to hold the socket a piece of burlap may be wrapped around
below the socket and a fold allowed to fall over the hand. Generally
means can be found to set the socket upright while pouring
full of alloy. Great care must be taken to see that there is no
water or surplus oil on the socket or mooring-rope before pouring
the alloy. (Nine parts lead, 1 part antimony.)</p>

<p>Mines are planted with a submergence of 5 feet below mean
low water.</p>

<p>Where ordinary anchors are used the mooring-ropes must be
prepared for depths obtained by sounding. If sockets are used,
the ropes for No. 32 cases are but 10 feet less than the ascertained
depths at mean low water. This allows 5 feet for submergence
and 5 feet for mine, mine bail, sockets, shackles, and anchor.
For the larger mine cases an additional allowance must be made
for the length of the cylindrical part of the case. Finally each
mooring-rope is tagged at each end with the number of the corresponding
mine.</p>

<p>Mine cables are cut to the following lengths, plus twice the
approximate depth of the water:</p>

<h4>MATERIAL FOR AND DUTIES ON THE WATER.</h4>

<p>Q. What apparatus is taken out on the distribution-box
boat?</p>

<p>A. One distribution-box, 1 buoy for same, 1 mooring-rope for
attaching buoy to distribution-box, 1 anchor sufficiently heavy
to hold distribution-box boat, 1 anchor buoy (keg), and rope for
same, 2 anchor shackles (1 for anchor and 1 for box), 1 pair
field glasses, alcohol, 2 alcohol lamps, cable tags, Turk's head,
collars, cotton waste, 2 files, 2 hammers, 2 heavy lines, knives,
marline, 2 marline spikes, 1 megaphone, 2 monkey wrenches,
2 pliers, protective tape, rubber cement, rubber tape, 2 scissors,
tin-foil, telephone, brass connectors, lashings.</p>

<p>The planter may locate the distribution-box boat anchor, and
in that case it, together with its buoy, would not be taken out
in the distribution-box boat.</p>

<p>Q. How and in what way are the cores of cable numbered?</p>

<p>A. They are numbered by the non-commissioned officer in
charge of the boat, who establishes communication with the casemate,
using the boat telephone, and working under the instructions
of the casemate electrician.</p>

<p>Nos. 1, 13, and 19 are easily selected by means of their special
marking; No. 19 is the center core; No. 13 is the marked core
in the inner row of six; and No. 1 is the marked core in the outer
row of twelve.</p>

<p>In the seven-cored cable there are no marked cores, the cores
being numbered under the instructions of the casemate electrician.</p>

<p>Q. How is multiple cable laid?</p>

<p>A. It is transported to the planter by tramway, hoisted by
steam-derrick to the <i>forward jacks</i>; it is then joined to the "shore
ends" of the cable; the planter then steams to the distribution-box
buoy and passes the end of the cable to the distribution
launch, where a Turk's head is made and all is ready to receive
the single-core cables for planting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>


<h4>PLANTING OF MINES.</h4>

<p>Q. How are single-core cables prepared?</p>


<p>A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<sup>o</sup> If the single-core cable has not been cut and coiled in
loading-room, place reel on jacks, cut 20 feet off
the end, unreel to lengths given previously, cut and
tag with mine number.</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Carry cable No. 19 on port side to after deck, keeping
tagged end forward and coil in figure eight, keeping
tagged end on bottom.</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Make Turk's head on each end, first slipping tagged
end through a mine cap.</p>

<p>4<sup>o</sup> Continue the operation above in the following order:</p>

<p>Nos. 1 to 9 starboard side.</p>

<p>Nos. 10 to 19 port side.</p></blockquote>

<p>Q. Describe how to place mines aboard and to attach to
cables preparatory to being planted.</p>

<p>A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<sup>o</sup> Place mine buoys, anchors, mooring-ropes, raising-ropes,
shackles, sister hooks, etc., aboard forward
and in convenient places.</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Place loaded mines aboard last, nine on starboard and
ten on port.</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Cut to proper length the loading wire, make a tapped
joint with S. C. conductor with Turk's head, previously
prepared through mine cap.</p>

<p>4<sup>o</sup> Fasten mine cap on mine, lash cables to bales, shackle
mooring-rope to mine, and anchor, lash mooring-rope
to mine cable every 5 feet (not done if automatic
anchor is used).</p>

<p>5<sup>o</sup> Cut raising-ropes 50 feet plus depth of water and
attach one end to anchor by anchor knot, the other
end to mine cable by two half hitches and a serving
of marline, secure at a few other points.</p>

<p>6<sup>o</sup> Attach about 60 feet small rope to mine buoys and
mark this rope every 5 feet, slip free end through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>maneuvering ring, and tie to buoy. (The mines,
anchors, cables, raising-ropes, and mine buoys are
now ready to be planted.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Q. Explain how to sling the mine and anchor, and prepare
it to "let go."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A.<br />
1<sup>o</sup> Mouse upper hooks of differential blocks and lash
well with marline the tripping hooks.</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Sling the anchor to the tripping hook on the differential
block of the forward davit, swing clear of rail, and
lower close to water.</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Perform similar operation with mine from after davit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Q. Describe the method of planting.</p>

<p>A. The planter now moves to the distribution-box boat, the
latter to the port, No. 10 cable is passed to the same, planter
now moves to No. 10 buoy, and when mine is abreast, the command
"let go" is given.</p>

<p>The tripping hook of the mine is released first, and that of
the anchor immediately after. The planter now circles to starboard,
passes to the rear, and comes up to the distribution-box
boat to the starboard. No. 9 is now passed, and planter moves
forward to the position of this mine, plants it, and returns to
distribution-box boat to repeat the operation till the group is
planted.</p>


<h4>CAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED.</h4>

<p>Men operating tripping hooks keep their feet free from all
cable. Men on after deck must keep entirely free of all cable
while being spent when planter is passing from distribution-box
boat to mine buoy.</p>

<p>If dynamite is used as explosive all mines should be covered
with paulines or burlap to protect them from the direct rays of
the sun.</p>

<p>Q. Name the apparatus on the boat used in planting mines.</p>

<p>A. Derricks, catheads, snatch-blocks, steam-winches, insulated
cable, cable-drum frames, circuit detector, boat-hooks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sounding-lines graduated to feet, davits, differential blocks,
mooring-ropes, raising-ropes, buoyant mines and anchors, shackles
and extra split pins for same, lashing-rope, alcohol, 2 alcohol
lamps, 1 cable cutter, cable tags, Turk's head, collars, cotton
waste, 4 files, 4 hammers, 6 heaving-lines, knives, marline, 2
marline spikes, 1 megaphone, 2 monkey wrenches, 4 pliers,
protective tape, rope, rubber cement, rubber tape, 2 scissors,
1 set of stencil numbers, tin-foil, and a measuring line which has
marks every 100 feet, with double marks at 300 and 600 feet.</p>

<p>Q. Give a method for marking the positions at which mines are
to be planted.</p>

<p>A. The distribution-box is located first, a buoy and anchor
being used as the mark. The center point of the group is located
next, then the two ends of the group. The launch is directed
over the spot selected from the map for the distribution-point
by means of base-end instruments at the primary and secondary
stations (these two instruments being set at the azimuth of the
selected spot), and by signals from these stations the launch drops
the anchor and buoy when it is at the intersection of the vertical
cross-wires of each instrument. The launch marks the center
of the group by moving approximately perpendicular to the line
of mines to the desired distance. The line of mines is then
determined by taking bearings and objects on shore (previously
determined from the map) or by a similar method to that of locating
the distribution-box buoy. Small planting-buoys are used for
this purpose. The distribution-box buoy is usually a large keg
or vinegar-barrel.</p>

<p>Q. How are soundings made?</p>

<p>A. By starting from either end of the "located group" and
making a sounding at every 100 feet.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Small Boat Drill.</span></h4>

<p>Q. Explain how a small boat used for marking and locating
is managed, and give the commands necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>A. Upon leaving wharf, "Shove off!" performed by designated
man.</p>

<p>To raise oars preliminary to rowing: "Up oars!" all oars
being held vertically, opposite rowlocks, blades athwart boat.</p>

<p>To lower oars into the water: "Let fall!"; all oars are dropped
easily into the water, without splashing, and quickly adjusted
into the rowlocks, and then held in position of "Oars!" (See
below.)</p>

<p>To move the boat forward: "Stand by to give way together!&mdash;<span class="smcap">GIVE
WAY TOGETHER</span>!" the boat being propelled forward at the
latter command, all the men taking a slow uniform stroke, being
guided by No. 1, feathering their oars as they come out of the
water and move forward.</p>

<p>To cease rowing temporarily: "Oars!"; at this command the
oars are raised out of the water to a horizontal position, blades
parallel with the surface of the water.</p>

<p>To rest without taking oars from rowlocks: "In oars," when
oars are drawn in and placed with handles under gunwales on
opposite side of boat from rowlocks.</p>

<p>To move backward a short distance: "Back water!" executed
opposite to "Give way together!"</p>

<p>To stop boat: "Hold water!"; the oars are held rigidly in
the water, blades vertical.</p>

<p>To stop boat quickly, as if running on a rock: "About face!
hold!" when the oarsmen turn about and hold blade in water,
stopping momentum of boat.</p>

<p>To turn to port: "Pull starboard, back port!" (To turn to
starboard, the opposite).</p>

<p>To make a landing: "In bow!"; the bow oar is raised vertically,
then lowered into its place in the boat, and the bow man
takes the boat-hook and guides boat gently into its place.</p>

<p>To cease rowing: "Way enough!"; the oars are raised vertically,
shoved properly in place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>


<h4>CORDAGE.</h4>

<p>Q. Name the important knots used in mine-work.</p>

<p>A. Anchor-knot or fisherman's bend, square knot, clove-hitch,
bowline, stopper, whipping, and short splice. (See plate of knots

<h4>FIRST-CLASS GUNNERS.</h4>

<h4>CARE AND PRESERVATION OF MINE MATERIAL.</h4>

<p>Q. How are mine-cases preserved and cared for?</p>

<p>A. They are painted light gray on the outside, and the screw-threads
covered with a mixture of lard-oil and white lead (4 parts
of tallow to 1 white lead). They are also either painted or
covered with protective material on the inside. They are then
stored on suitable racks inside a "torpedo storehouse."</p>

<p>Q. How are all bearing surfaces, such as screw-threads, prepared
for storage?</p>

<p>A. By first thoroughly cleaning them with brushes, kerosene,
waste, etc., and then covering with the above mixture of white
lead and tallow.</p>

<p>Q. How is the motor-generator cared for?</p>

<p>A. Fill all oil-holes, and keep all parts free from dust and
foreign material; see that all connections are tight; see that all
brushes are in good condition, and replace worn ones by new
ones. Use very fine <i>sandpaper</i> for slight inequalities of the commutator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. How are the mine-panel and the switchboard cared
for?</p>

<p>A. See that all bolts to busses are tight, that all lamps are
screwed home, that all contacts are clean and free from gum or
dirt, that all switches work properly and all contacts correctly
made.</p>

<p>Q. How should electric lights be cared for?</p>

<p>A. They should be kept clean and polished. Any snap-switch
that sparks badly should be replaced. No verdigris should
be allowed to accumulate on any brass fittings. When a lamp
becomes dull or black inside, a new one should replace it. When
any fuse is blown out, new ones should be put in. (Never use
copper wire as a substitute for a fuse.)</p>

<p>Q. How should transformers be cared for?</p>

<p>A. Simply kept clean and in a dry place. They should be
tested with a circuit-detector once in a while.</p>

<p>Q. How is the charging-generator cared for?</p>

<p>A. Keep free from dirt or rust, fill all oil-holes, clean the
commutator with a dry rag, keep the brushes set so as to make
good contact, and when not in use cover with a rubber paulin.</p>

<p>Q. How is the oil-engine cared for?</p>

<p>A. The oil-engine should be kept clean and nicely painted,
all oil-holes filled, the water-tank filled and free from mud and
sediment, the vaporizer examined from time to time and kept free
from packed carbon, the piston clean and well oiled, the poppet-valves
tight and free from any clogging material, the starting-torch
clean and free from soot.</p>

<p>Q. When putting a piece of machinery out of commission what
is done?</p>

<p>A. All bearing surfaces are exposed, cleaned, and covered with
white lead and lard-oil or a similar substitute preservative. All
small loose parts are removed, covered with cosmic wrapped in
burlap, and stored under cover. The machine should also be
housed.</p>

<p>Q. Name some of the principal cleaning materials.</p>

<p>A. Steel scrapers, button and wire brushes, waste, pomade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sandpaper, emery and crocus cloth, gasoline, kerosene, and
alcohol.</p>

<p>Q. Name some preserving materials.</p>

<p>A. Cosmic, white lead, red lead, raw linseed oil, turpentine,
beef tallow, drier, lamp black, pumice stone, varnish, asphaltum
varnish, paint brushes, shellac, graphite paint and insulac.</p>

<p>Q. Name some uses of each.</p>

<p>A. Cosmic: Covering bright parts of engines, generators,
motors, etc., when out of commission.</p>

<p>White Lead: (4 pts. W. L. to 1 of tallow) Used on screw-threads
of mine cases, steel threads, compound plugs, bolts, nuts,
washers, surfaces of flute joints, etc.</p>

<p>Caution: <i>Never use this on a joint where electrical contact is
to be made</i>.</p>

<p>Red Lead: (100 pounds red lead ground in linseed-oil with
5 gallons raw linseed added.) On mine cases after being scraped.
As a preliminary coat for iron surfaces of engines, generators,
etc.</p>

<p>Raw Linseed, Turpentine, Drier, and Lampblack, for making
different kinds of paint. Turpentine is also used to clean brushes,
etc.</p>

<p>Tallow: For mixing with white lead to form a preservative.</p>

<p>Pumice-stone: When powdered and mixed with oil is used
to rub down surfaces, as the first coat of varnish on an engine.</p>

<p>Varnish: As a finishing coat for metal and wood surfaces not
exposed to heat or water.</p>

<p>Asphaltum Varnish: For painting anchors, distribution-boxes,
mooring-sockets, shackles, sister hooks, junction boxes, iron
work of operating boards and power panels, etc.</p>

<p>Shellac: For covering decks, spars, etc.</p>

<p>Graphite Paint: For painting hot parts of engines, etc.</p>

<p>Insulac: For preserving insulation on electrical instruments,
etc.</p>

<p>Q. How is an engine painted?</p>

<p>A. All hot surfaces should be painted with black graphite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
paint. All other surfaces after being thoroughly scraped and
sand-papered should be given a priming coat of red-lead paint.
This should be lightly rubbed down with powdered pumice
and oil, then two coats of preferably steel color metal paint applied
and rubbed. Two coats of varnish are now applied and
rubbed with pumice as above, after each coat becomes thoroughly
dry.</p>


<h4>HANDLING HIGH EXPLOSIVES.</h4>

<p>Q. Name some high explosives used in submarine mining.</p>

<p>A. Wet gun-cotton principally, dynamite, and other high
explosives that can be readily purchased in commercial life in
case of emergency.</p>

<p>Q. Why is wet gun-cotton to be preferred as a high explosive?</p>

<p>A. Because it is perfectly safe to handle. It can only be
detonated by first detonating a small piece of dry gun-cotton
placed near it.</p>

<p>Q. What are some important precautions to be observed
when loading mines?</p>

<p>A.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>1<sup>o</sup> Always wear rubbers when entering the magazine to
get the explosive. (The main supply is always kept in
a cool magazine.)</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Never drop or slide along the floor boxes of high explosive.</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Do not expose high explosive to sun's rays or heat.</p>

<p>4<sup>o</sup> Bring only one box to the loading-room at a time,
then, when used, burn the box and sawdust in a safe
place.</p>

<p>5<sup>o</sup> Place canvas or burlap on floor of loading-room, then
place mine on skids upon this.</p>

<p>6<sup>o</sup> Use rubber gloves when handling dynamite.</p>

<p>7<sup>o</sup> Sweep floor frequently and throw sweepings in
water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p>8<sup>o</sup> After mine is loaded by use of funnel, carefully clean
threads with a soft brush, then smear plenty of
ruberine on threads.</p>

<p>9<sup>o</sup> Never saw or bore a dry guncotton cake.</p>

<p>10<sup>o</sup> Never open a mine loaded with dynamite without first
consulting an officer.</p>

<p>11<sup>o</sup> <i>Never thaw out dynamite near a stove.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Q. How is dynamite that is frozen thawed out?</p>

<p>A. Place the frozen dynamite in an open watertight can.
Place this can in another can of warm water, such that the heat
of the warm water only will do the thawing.</p>


<h4>KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF THE PLOTTING-BOARD AND AZIMUTH
INSTRUMENT.</h4>

<p>Q. Describe the plotting board.</p>

<p>A. It is the same as that used for guns except the gun arm
and its parts are not used. The scale is ordinarily 100 yards =
1 inch.</p>

<p>Q. How is it used for mine firing?</p>

<p>A. The ship is <i>tracked by plotting</i> points of intersection of the
primary and secondary arm every 20 seconds. After several
positions are plotted a point is predicted at a certain interval
of time ahead and by means of a "combination prediction and
speed scale" the time of the arrival of the ship over the mine
which was previously plotted on the board is obtained and this
is the time of firing that mine. This is called "judgment firing."</p>

<p>Q. Describe and use the azimuth instrument.</p>

<p>A. See Examination for First-class Gunners for Gun-companies.</p>


<h4>BATTERIES, GENERATORS, AND SEARCH-LIGHTS.</h4>

<p>Q. Name the batteries used in mine work.</p>

<p>A. Casemate battery (storage&mdash;40 cells) and boat telephone
battery (either storage or dry cells sufficient to give 15 volts).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Q. Describe the casemate battery. (See Fig. 103.)</p>

<p>A. This is a storage-battery of the standard chloride accumulator
type. It is composed of 40 cells, type D-5 (D = size of
plate 5, the number of plates). D-5 has two positive and three
negative plates, each 6" × 6". Positive plates are of a brownish
color, negative grayish. These plates are contained in a glass
jar nearly filled with electrolyte (one part sulphuric acid to five
parts distilled water by volume makes electrolyte of 1·210 specific
gravity. <i>The acid must be poured into the water.</i>)</p>

<p>These glass jars are placed in trays of sand and the trays rest
on glass insulators. The normal charge and discharge rate
of this battery is 5 amperes, although in starting the motor generator
a much higher current is drawn from the battery. The
voltage is about 80.</p>

<p>Q. What precautions are necessary to keep it in order?</p>

<p>A.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1<sup>o</sup> Do not overcharge, overdischarge, or allow to stand
completely discharged. (Battery should be charged when discharge
is 1.8 volts per cell.)</p>

<p>2<sup>o</sup> Keep plates covered with electrolyte about &frac34; inch above
top of plates. If not at proper height add distilled
water.</p>

<p>3<sup>o</sup> Keep cells free from sediment.</p>

<p>4<sup>o</sup> A record of each cell (voltage and specific gravity)
should be kept each time the battery is charged,
and this should be done about once a week.</p>

<p>5<sup>o</sup> The indications of a complete charge are: when positive
plates have a deep chocolate color, negative light
slate, cells gas freely, each cell reads about 2·5 volts,
and 1.210 specific gravity, and when no perceptible
rise in voltage occurs for a lapse of 10 to 15
minutes.</p>

<p>6<sup>o</sup> If any low cells develop, bring them back into condition
immediately.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) If voltage is very low, look for sediment or foreign
matter, then charge separately.</p></blockquote>

<p>Q. Describe a searchlight.</p>

<p>A. It consists of an iron cylinder mounted on an iron pedestal
in a yoke. The cylinder contains a parabolic mirror in the back,
a series of glass strips in the front, and two "carbons" in the
middle.</p>

<p>The electric current in passing through the carbons heats the
points to a very high degree, producing a brilliant light. This
light is reflected by the mirror towards the front, and the mirror,
being of a curved form, also converges the rays of light. Underneath
most searchlights are electric motors for traversing and
elevating, and these motors are started or stopped by means of
switches in a contrivance called a "controller," which is always
placed at a distance from the light.</p>

<p>Q. Point out the following parts of a 36" searchlight: hand
star-wheel for slow vertical movement; wheel for throwing out split
nut used for connecting or disconnecting the drum from the
base mechanism; wheel for slow horizontal movement; hand
star-wheel for clamping turntable to center-pin for electrical control;
wood handles on drum for moving drum by hand; hand-wheel
for clamping hand star-wheel <i>A</i> when electric control is
used; controller-switch; controller-handle; controller fuse-box;
controller-coupling for connecting cable from the projector;
focusing-screw; socket for inserting wrench to operate lamp-switch
used for cutting out feeding-magnet; socket for inserting
wrench when feeding by hand; door used for adjusting the carbons
and for cleaning the front door; door used when carbons
are to be adjusted or changed; front door; door used when
adjusting negative carbons or cleaning the mirror; horizontal
peepsights; vertical peepsights; sliding case to be opened when
lamp mechanism is to be inspected; projector main switch;
latches for fastening base-sheeting; base-sheeting.</p>

<p>Inspect for contact of lightning-arrester carbons:
a piece of writing-paper should pass between them
easily. See that the ends of the line and ground
wires do not touch any other part after passing
through the binding-posts.</p>

<p>Disconnect the line and ground wires. If the
bell rings now, (1. Short circuit on line) is clearly
indicated, but if it does not ring and still turns
hard, (3. Short circuit in phone) is indicated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>If the handle does not turn hard, the operator
takes up (2. Mechanical trouble in the bell) and
sees that the striker is not bound by the metallic
cap over it or by the wood of the box, also that the
armature can be moved by hand and that the striker
will touch the gongs when the armature is so moved.
The first trouble can be remedied; the others should
be reported.</p>

<p>(4. Open circuit in the phone). Open the
magneto box, see that contact is made between shaft
and spring at <i>U</i> and between the springs at <i>V</i>
when the handle is turned. The last may fail
because the shaft is caught at some place, as where
it enters the box or the collar on the shaft may have
slipped or the springs may be bent. The spring at
<i>U</i> may be held against the end of the shaft with a
pencil, during a test, to insure good contact. A
spark seen at <i>U</i> or <i>V</i> indicates poor contact. If
the operator cannot easily correct these faults, he
should report as nearly as practicable what trouble
he found.</p>

<p>Test for (5. Magneto does not generate) by
moistening the tips of the fingers and touch terminals
of magneto. Turn the handles, and if no shock is
felt, a failure to generate is indicated.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Battery, (<i>b</i>) connections or wiring,
(<i>c</i>) transmitter, (<i>d</i>) primary coil.</p>

<p>2. Distant receiver out of order.</p>

<p>3. Home secondary coil short-circuited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Operator's test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disconnect line and ground wires
and connect binding-posts <i>R</i> and <i>C</i> with a piece of
wire, thus short-circuiting the phone. Place the
receiver to the ear and scratch gently with the
finger-nail on the inside of the transmitter mouthpiece.</p>

<p>If this is distinctly heard, the local circuit and
receiver are all right.</p>

<p>If no sound results, put the receiver to the ear,
lower and raise hook lever, also open and close the
two-way switch. If a distinct click is heard for each
of these, the local circuit is all right but the transmitter
may not be in good order and a report should
be made.</p>

<p>If no sound results from above, make sure
that the switch contact is good and no pivots are
loose, that all contacts are good, that the connections
at battery terminals are good with no green
substance on the wires or posts, that the water in
the jars is up to the prescribed point, about an
inch from the neck of the cell, that the zincs and
carbons are not touching, that the zincs are not
eaten off, and that the zinc of one cell is connected
to the carbon of the other, and that there are no
crystals on the zincs and carbons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<p>The operator should correct any of these that he
can, reporting the others.</p>

<p>For (2. Distant receiver out of order) the operator
at the distant phone should try the tests above.
If these give no sound in his receiver, he should try
another receiver, if one is available. He may try
a new cord or substitute two pieces of wire for it.</p></blockquote>

<p>3d. <i>Can neither hear nor be heard.</i></p>

<p>Analysis: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This indicates general trouble:</p>

<p>1. In the phones.</p>

<p>2. In the line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Operators' test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go over the phone carefully, looking
for poor contacts, as when an insulated wire is put
in the binding-posts, binding-posts not screwed
down tight, ends of wires passing through post
touching other parts, contacts at cells and condition
of cells as noted before. Disconnect the line and
ground wires and test out phones as indicated.
See that ground wire is in the middle post. If there
are fuses in the line, see that they are not burned out.
If no trouble is found to exist when the line is disconnected,
report line out of order.</p></blockquote>
